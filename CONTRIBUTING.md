# Introduction

### Welcome to n8n!

First off, thank you for considering contributing to n8n. It's people like you that make n8n such a great tool.

### Why these guidelines are important

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers building n8n, and the writers that have spent many hours documenting it. In return, they should reciprocate that respect by assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### What you can help us with

n8n is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community - you! There are many ways to contribute. If you want to contribute to the n8n codebase, please visit the [code repo](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n).

This repository will focus on maintaining and improving the documentation of n8n, helping make n8n accessible to more people!

# Ground Rules
### Responsibilities

* Ensure that anything you write is consistent with the same structure and writing conventions as the rest of the documentation.
* Keep your writing as concise as possible.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make, before submitting a PR. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Make sure to include commit messages that explain what you have changed.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Getting started
## First time contributor?

If you are a first time contributor to an open-source project; here's a quick rundown of what you can do to contribute to this repo:
- Write credential documentation
- Write node documentation

Fork this repo, make any changes you want and submit a [pull request](http://makeapullrequest.com/) for it to be considered.  

You can also check out [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/) for useful resources to help contribute!

# Submitting a contribution

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Send a pull request.
    * Sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA), with the CLA assistant.

### Small and/or "obvious" fixes

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, simply comment on that line and raise an issue, and a contributor will include it in their PR.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new pages or creative thinking. Some likely examples include the following:

* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up

# How to suggest an enhancement
If you find yourself wishing for a section that doesn't exist in these docs, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs.  

Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process

* The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis, multiple times a week. We assess the quality of your PRs and leave relevant feedback.
* After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

# Community

Besides GitHub, you can start discussions with the community on https://community.n8n.io/.
