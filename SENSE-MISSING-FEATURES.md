# SENSE App - Missing Features & Improvement Roadmap

## ✅ Daily Reset Status: **IT WORKS!**

The app **DOES** reset daily tasks at Eastern midnight, BUT with one caveat:

### How It Works:
```
1. User opens app → Checks if date changed → Auto-resets if new day
2. App is open at midnight → Countdown hits 00:00:00 → Auto-reloads → Resets
3. Preserves: XP, coins, inventory, streak (if all tasks completed)
4. Resets: Daily tasks, calorie log, mission slots
```

### ⚠️ Potential Issue:
If the user **closes the app before midnight** and doesn't open it until 2+ days later, the streak might not properly detect missed days.

**Fix needed**: Store a daily history to track missed days properly.

## 🚨 Critical Missing Features

### 1. **Reward Redemption System** ❌
**Problem**: You can BUY items, but can't USE them!
- Buy "Rest Day Pass" → It sits in inventory
- Buy "Cheat Meal" → Can't actually redeem it

**Solution Needed**:
```typescript
// Add "Use" button for each inventory item
// Add redemption logic:
- Rest Day Pass: Skip dailies without losing streak
- Cheat Meal: Toggle a "claimed" state for the day
- Movie Night: Show a congratulations message
```

### 2. **Undo/Edit Functionality** ❌
**Problem**: Accidentally click "Complete" → No way to undo!

**Solution Needed**:
- Undo button (within 5 seconds)
- Long-press to delete calorie entries
- Confirmation dialog for purchases

### 3. **Proper Missed Day Detection** ❌
**Problem**: Streak doesn't properly handle multiple missed days

**Current**:
```
Day 1: Complete all tasks → Streak = 1
Day 2: Miss (app not opened)
Day 3: Open app → Streak = 0
```

**Issue**: What if user misses 5 days? Still shows streak = 0, but doesn't know they missed 5 days.

**Solution Needed**:
```typescript
type DailyHistory = {
  date: string;
  tasksCompleted: string[];
  allCompleted: boolean;
  xpEarned: number;
}

// Store history of last 30 days
// Calculate streak properly on each open
// Show "You missed X days" message
```

### 4. **Manual Food Entry** ❌
**Problem**: Calorie scanner requires camera. What if:
- Camera broken
- No camera permission
- Want to quickly log something

**Solution Needed**:
- Search bar to find foods by name
- Manual calorie entry field
- Recent foods quick-add

### 5. **Task History/Analytics** ❌
**Problem**: Can't see past performance

**What's Missing**:
- Weekly completion rate chart
- Monthly XP earned graph
- Most completed tasks
- Average calories per day
- Best streak ever recorded

### 6. **Notifications** ❌
**Problem**: No reminders!

**What's Needed**:
- "2 hours until midnight - 3 tasks remaining!"
- "Mission available - Cold Shower Challenge ready!"
- "Streak at risk - 0 tasks completed today"

### 7. **Custom Tasks** ❌
**Problem**: Daily tasks are hard-coded

**Solution Needed**:
```typescript
// Allow users to:
- Add custom daily tasks
- Set custom XP values
- Enable/disable default tasks
- Set task difficulty (easy/medium/hard)
```

### 8. **Progress Photos** ❌
For a fitness app, this is crucial!

**What's Needed**:
- Take weekly progress photos
- Compare side-by-side
- Track body measurements
- Weight tracking graph

### 9. **Workout Logging** ❌
**Problem**: Exercise library shows videos but doesn't track workouts

**What's Needed**:
- Log sets/reps/weight for each exercise
- Track personal records
- See strength progression over time
- Generate workout plans

### 10. **Data Export/Backup** ❌
**Problem**: Data only in localStorage → Can lose everything!

**What's Needed**:
- Export to JSON
- Import from backup
- Cloud sync (optional)
- Export to CSV for analysis

---

## 🔧 Technical Issues to Fix

### 1. **Mission Cooldowns Don't Persist**
```typescript
// Current: Cooldowns reset on page refresh
// Fix: Save cooldown state to localStorage with timestamps

type MissionSlot = {
  mission?: Mission;
  cooldownEndTime: number; // Unix timestamp
  lastId?: string;
}
```

### 2. **No Validation on Task Completion**
```typescript
// Current: Can spam "Complete" button and earn XP multiple times (if fast enough)
// Fix: Disable button immediately on click, add debouncing
```

### 3. **Calorie Scanner Performance**
```typescript
// Current: OCR on every scan (slow)
// Fix:
- Add caching for scanned items
- Pre-process image for better OCR
- Add manual crop tool
```

### 4. **No Error Recovery**
```typescript
// Current: If localStorage quota exceeded, app breaks
// Fix: Handle quota errors, show warning, allow data pruning
```

## 🐛 Known Bugs

1. **Mission cooldowns reset on page refresh** → Timers don't persist
2. **Rapid clicking can complete tasks multiple times** → No debouncing
3. **Streak calculation fails for multi-day gaps** → Assumes max 1 day missed
4. **Camera permissions not properly handled** → No fallback message
5. **localStorage quota not checked** → App can crash if storage full

---

## 💡 Quick Wins (Easy to Add)

### 1. Add Undo Button (5 minutes):
```typescript
const [lastAction, setLastAction] = useState(null);

function undoLastAction() {
  if (lastAction && Date.now() - lastAction.timestamp < 5000) {
    // Reverse the action
    setCompleted(lastAction.previousState);
    setXP(lastAction.previousXP);
    setCoins(lastAction.previousCoins);
  }
}
```

### 2. Manual Calorie Entry (10 minutes):
```typescript
// Add a simple input field:
<input
  type="number"
  placeholder="Enter calories manually"
  onChange={(e) => addManualCalories(e.target.value)}
/>
```

### 3. Persist Mission Cooldowns (15 minutes):
```typescript
// Change cooldown to use timestamps:
const endTime = Date.now() + (MISSION_COOLDOWN_S * 1000);
// On load: calculate remaining = Math.max(0, endTime - Date.now())
```

### 4. Add History Tracking (20 minutes):
```typescript
type HistoryEntry = {
  date: string;
  tasksCompleted: number;
  totalTasks: number;
  xpEarned: number;
}
// Store last 30 days in localStorage
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements Needed

1. **Loading states** - Show spinners during saves
2. **Success animations** - Confetti on level up
3. **Sound effects** - More varied sounds for different actions
4. **Haptic feedback** - Vibration on mobile for completions
5. **Keyboard shortcuts** - Quick navigation (1-5 for tasks)
6. **Offline indicator** - Show when not connected
7. **Install prompt** - PWA installation banner
8. **Onboarding** - First-time user tutorial

---

## 📱 Mobile-Specific Issues

1. **No pull-to-refresh** - Native mobile behavior missing
2. **No swipe gestures** - Swipe to complete tasks?
3. **Camera orientation** - Scanner doesn't handle rotation well
4. **Keyboard covers inputs** - Input fields hidden on mobile
5. **No install as app** - Not a PWA yet

---

## 🔐 Security/Privacy Concerns

1. **No data encryption** - localStorage is plain text
2. **No privacy policy** - Required if tracking users
3. **No rate limiting** - Can spam API calls (if you add a backend)
4. **Camera permissions** - Should explain why needed
5. **No user authentication** - If you want multi-device sync

---

## 🚀 What Would Make This Production-Ready?

### Must Have:
- ✅ All High Priority improvements
- ✅ Error handling for all edge cases
- ✅ Data backup/export functionality

---

## 📝 Summary

### What Works Great:
✅ Daily reset at midnight EST
✅ localStorage persistence
✅ Smooth animations and UI
✅ Basic gamification (XP, coins, levels)
✅ Food scanner concept
✅ Exercise library

### What's Critically Missing:
❌ Reward redemption (can't USE bought items)
❌ Undo functionality
❌ Proper history tracking
❌ Manual food entry
❌ Mission cooldown persistence

### What Would Make It Amazing:
🌟 Workout logging with progress tracking
