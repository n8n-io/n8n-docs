To pin data in a node:

1. Run the node to load data.
2. In the **OUTPUT** view, select **Pin data** <span class="n8n-inline-image">![Pin data icon](/_images/data/data-pinning/data-pinning-button.png){.off-glb}</span>. When data pinning is active, the button is disabled and a "This data is pinned" banner is displayed in the **OUTPUT** view.

/// note | Nodes that output binary data
You can't pin data if the output data includes binary data.
