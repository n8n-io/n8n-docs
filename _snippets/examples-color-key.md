To load the template into your n8n instance:

1. Download the workflow JSON file.
1. Open a new workflow in your n8n instance.
1. Copy in the JSON, or select **Workflow menu** <span class="n8n-inline-image">![Workflow menu icon](/_images/common-icons/three-dots-horizontal.png){.off-glb}</span> > **Import from file...**.

The example workflows use Sticky Notes to guide you:

* Yellow: notes and information.
* Green: instructions to run the workflow.
* Orange: you need to change something to make the workflow work.
* Blue: draws attention to a key feature of the example.
