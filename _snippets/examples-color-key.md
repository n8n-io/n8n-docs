To load the template into your n8n instance:

1. Download the workflow JSON file.
1. Open a new workflow in your n8n instance.
1. Copy in the JSON, or select **Workflow menu** <span class="inline-image">![Workflow menu icon](/_images/common-icons/three-dots-horizontal.png){.off-glb}</span> > **Import from file...**.

The example workflows use Sticky Notes to guide you:
