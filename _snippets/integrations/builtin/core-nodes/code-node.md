Use the Code node to write custom JavaScript or Python and run it as a step in your workflow.

/// note | Coding in n8n
This page gives usage information about the Code node. For more guidance on coding in n8n, refer to the [Code](/code/index.md) section. It includes:

* Reference documentation on [Built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview.md)
* Guidance on [Handling dates](/code/cookbook/luxon.md) and [Querying JSON](/code/cookbook/jmespath.md)
* A growing collection of examples in the [Cookbook](/code/cookbook/code-node/index.md)
///

/// note | Examples and templates
For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Code integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/code/){:target=_blank .external-link} page.

/// note | Function and Function Item nodes
The Code node replaces the Function and Function Item nodes from version 0.198.0. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the [Function node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.function.md){:target=_blank .external-link} and [Function Item node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.functionItem.md){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Usage

How to use the Code node.

### Choose a mode

There are two modes:

* **Run Once for All Items**: this is the default. When your workflow runs, the code in the code node executes once, regardless of how many input items there are.
* **Run Once for Each Item**: choose this if you want your code to run for every input item.

## JavaScript

The Code node supports Node.js.

### Supported JavaScript features

The Code node supports:

* Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly.
* Writing to your browser console using `console.log`. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows.

### External libraries

If you self-host n8n, you can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Code node. To learn how to enable external modules, refer to the [Enable modules in Code node](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node.md) guide.

If you use n8n Cloud, you can't import external npm modules. n8n makes two modules available for you:

* [crypto Node.js module](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/crypto.html){:target=_blank .external-link}
* [moment npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment){:target=_blank .external-link}

### Built-in methods and variables

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview.md) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `$variableName` or `$methodName()`. Type `$` in the Code node or expressions editor to see a list of suggested methods and variables.

### Keyboard shortcuts

The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the [list of keyboard shortcuts](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/keyboard-shortcuts.md).

## Python

n8n added Python support in version 1.0. It doesn't include a Python executable. Instead, n8n provides Python support using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/){:target=_blank .external-link}, which is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. This limits the available Python packages to the [Packages included with Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html#packages-in-pyodide){:target=_blank .external-link}. n8n downloads the package automatically the first time you use it.

/// note | Slower than JavaScript
The Code node takes longer to process Python than JavaScript. This is due to the extra compilation steps.
///
### Built-in methods and variables

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview.md) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `_variableName` or `_methodName()`. Type `_` in the Code node to see a list of suggested methods and variables.

### Keyboard shortcuts

The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the [list of keyboard shortcuts](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/keyboard-shortcuts.md).

## File system and HTTP requests

You can't access the file system or make HTTP requests. Use the following nodes instead:

* [Read/Write File From Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile.md)
* [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md)

## Coding in n8n

There are two places where you can use code in n8n: the Code node and the expressions editor. When using either area, there are some key concepts you need to know, as well as some built-in methods and variables to help with common tasks.

### Key concepts

When working with the Code node, you need to understand the following concepts:

* [Data structure](/data/data-structure.md): understand the data you receive in the Code node, and requirements for outputting data from the node.
* [Item linking](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/index.md): learn how data items work, and how to link to items from previous nodes. You need to handle item linking in your code when the number of input and output items doesn't match.

### Built-in methods and variables

n8n includes built-in methods and variables. These provide support for:

* Accessing specific item data
* Accessing data about workflows, executions, and your n8n environment
* Convenience variables to help with data and time

Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/overview.md) for more information.
