For Google Cloud apps with **Publishing status** set to **Testing** and **User type** set to **External**, consent and tokens expire after seven days. Refer to [Google Cloud Platform Console Help | Setting up your OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615?hl=en#zippy=%2Ctesting) for more information. To resolve this, reconnect the app in the n8n credentials modal.
