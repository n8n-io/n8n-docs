If using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning **Google hasn't verified this app**. To avoid this, you can add your email to the list of testers for the app. To do so, go to the ["Audience" page](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience) page and add the email you're signing in with to the list of "Test users".

If you need to use credentials generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), follow the instructions in [Google Cloud documentation | Authorization errors: Google hasn't verified this app](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/reference/errors/authorization#google_hasnt_verified_this_app){:target=_blank .external-link}.
