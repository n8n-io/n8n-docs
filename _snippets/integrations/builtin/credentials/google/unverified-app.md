If using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning **Google hasn't verified this app**. To avoid this:

- If your app **User Type** is **Internal**, create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate.  
- If your app **User Type** is **External**, you can add your email to the list of testers for the app: go to the [**Audience** ](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience) page and add the email you're signing in with to the list of **Test users**.

If you need to use credentials generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), follow the instructions in [Google Cloud documentation | Authorization errors: Google hasn't verified this app](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/reference/errors/authorization#google_hasnt_verified_this_app).
