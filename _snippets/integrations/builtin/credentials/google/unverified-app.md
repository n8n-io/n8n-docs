If using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning **Google hasn't verified this app**. To avoid this, you can create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate. 

If you need to use credentials generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), follow the instructions in [Google Cloud documentation | Authorization errors: Google hasn't verified this app](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/reference/errors/authorization#google_hasnt_verified_this_app){:target=_blank .external-link}.
