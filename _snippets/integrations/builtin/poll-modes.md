To generate a Cron expression, you can use [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru){:target=_blank .external-link}. Paste the Cron expression that you generated using crontab guru in the **Cron Expression** field in n8n.

#### Examples

If you want to trigger your workflow every day at 04:08:30, enter the following in the **Cron Expression** field.
```
30 8 4 * * *
```

If you want to trigger your workflow every day at 04:08, enter the following in the **Cron Expression** field.

#### Why there are six asterisks in the Cron expression

The sixth asterisk in the Cron expression represents seconds. Setting this is optional. The node will execute even if you don't set the value for seconds.
