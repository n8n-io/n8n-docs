# Introduction

Welcome to the Doc² Certification Course Level I!

## Is this course right for me?

This course teaches you how to automate processes with no code using Doc² and is meant to jumpstart your qualification as an automation expert.

This course is for you if you:

- Want to automate things in your personal life
- Are looking for quick ways to automate common business processes

## What will I learn?

By the end of this course you will know:

- How to set up Doc² and navigate the Editor UI
- How data is structured in n8n
- How to configure different node parameters and add credentials
- When and how to use conditional logic in workflows
- How to schedule and control workflows

You will build two workflows:

We believe in learning by doing. You can expect some theoretical information about the basic concepts and components of Doc², followed by practice of building workflows step by step.
