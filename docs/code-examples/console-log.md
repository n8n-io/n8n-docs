# Using console.log in the Code node

You can use `console.log()` in the Code node to help when writing and debugging your code.

For help opening your browser console, refer to [this guide by Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/support/faqs/browserconsole/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

For technical information on `console.log()`, refer to the [MDN developer docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/log){:target=_blank .external-link}.

For example, copy the following code into a Code node, then open your console and run the node:

```js
let a = "apple";
console.log(a);
```
