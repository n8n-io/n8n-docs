# Current node input

Methods for working with the input of the current node. Some methods and variables aren't available in the Code node.

/// note | Python support
You can use Python in the Code node. It isn't available in expressions.
///
=== "JavaScript"
	| Method | Description | Available in Code node? |
	| ------ | ----------- | :-------------------------: |
	| `$binary` | Shorthand for `$input.item.binary`. Incoming binary data from a node | :x: |
	| `$input.item` | The input item of the current node that's being processed. Refer to [Item linking](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/index.md) for more information on paired items and item linking. | :white_check_mark: |
	| `$input.all()` | All input items in current node. | :white_check_mark: |
	| `$input.first()` | First input item in current node. | :white_check_mark: |
	| `$input.last()` | Last input item in current node. | :white_check_mark: |
	| `$input.params` | Object containing the query settings of the previous node. This includes data such as the operation it ran, result limits, and so on.  | :white_check_mark: |
	| `$json` | Shorthand for `$input.item.json`. Incoming JSON data from a node. Refer to [Data structure](/data/data-structure.md) for information on item structure. | :white_check_mark: (when running once for each item) |
	| `$input.context.noItemsLeft` | Boolean. Only available when working with the Loop Over Items node. Provides information about what's happening in the node. Use this to determine whether the node is still processing items. | :white_check_mark: |
