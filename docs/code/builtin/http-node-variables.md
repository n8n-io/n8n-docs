# HTTP node variables

Variables for working with HTTP node requests and responses when using pagination.

Refer to [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) for guidance on using the HTTP node, including configuring pagination.

Refer to [HTTP Request node cookbook | Pagination](/code/cookbook/http-node/pagination.md) for example pagination configurations.

/// note | HTTP node only
These variables are for use in expressions in the HTTP node. You can't use them in other nodes.
