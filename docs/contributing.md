## Help out the community

You can participate in the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/){:target=_blank class=.external-link} and help the community members out with their questions.

When sharing workflows in the community forum for debugging, use code blocks. Use triple backticks ` ``` ` to wrap the workflow JSON in a code block.

The following video demonstrates the steps of sharing workflows on the community forum:

The repository for the docs is [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs){:target=_blank class=.external-link} and the guidelines for contributing to the docs are [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md){:target=_blank class=.external-link}.

## Write a blog post

You can write an article for the [n8n blog](https://n8n.io/blog/){:target=_blank class=.external-link}. Your article can be, for example, a [workflow tutorial](https://n8n.io/blog/tag/tutorial/){:target=_blank class=.external-link}, an opinion piece on automation, or some domain-specific [automation ideas](https://n8n.io/blog/tag/ideas/){:target=_blank class=.external-link}. Surprise us!

n8n has the following process for guest contributions to our blog:

1. **Pitch:** Fill out [this typeform](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/VYiRI7WN?typeform-source=n8n.io){:target=_blank class=.external-link} to tell us what kind of content you'd like to contribute.
2. **Evaluation:** We evaluate your content idea and, if it matches our content topics and target audience, we give you green light to start writing and submit the article.
3. **Review**: You submit your finished article as a Google Doc and we start reviewing and editing it. This is usually an interactive, back-and-forth process, where we might ask for clarification and make suggestions in the doc for you to review. Depending on the length of the article and the required changes, the review process could take between a couple of days to a week or two.
4. **Publishing:** Once all the changes and comments are resolved, we schedule the article to be published on our blog.

## Refer a candidate

Do you know someone who would be a great fit for one of our [open positions](https://n8n.io/careers){:target=_blank class=.external-link}? Refer them to us! In return, we'll pay you €1,000 when the referral successfully passes their probationary period.

Here's how this works:

1. **Search**: Have a look at the description and requirements of each role, and consider if someone you know would be a great fit.
2. **Referral**: Once you've identified a potential candidate, send an email to [Jobs at n8n](mailto:jobs@n8n.io) with the subject line *Employee referral - [job title]* and a short description of the person you're referring (and the reason why). Also, tell your referral to apply for the job through our [careers page](https://n8n.io/careers){:target=_blank class=.external-link}.
3. **Evaluation**: We'll screen the application and inform you about the next steps of the hiring process.
4. **Reward**: As soon as your referral has successfully finished the probationary period, we'll reward you for your efforts by transferring the €1,000 to your bank account.
