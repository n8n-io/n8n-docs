# Introduction

Welcome to the **n8n Course Level 1**!

## Is this course right for me?

This course teaches you how to automate processes with no code using n8n and is meant to jumpstart your qualification as an automation expert.

This course is for you if you:

- Want to automate things in your personal life
- Are looking for quick ways to automate common business processes

## What will I learn in this course?

We believe in learning by doing. You can expect some theoretical information about the basic concepts and components of n8n, followed by practice of building workflows step by step.

By the end of this course you will know:

- How to set up n8n and navigate the Editor UI
- How data is structured in n8n
- How to configure different node parameters and add credentials
- When and how to use conditional logic in workflows
- How to schedule and control workflows
- How to import, download, and share workflows with others

You will build two workflows:

- A two-node workflow to get articles from Hacker News
- A seven-node workflow to help your client get records from a data warehouse, filter them, make calculations, and notify team members about the results


## What do I need to get started?

- **n8n set up**: You can use the [self-hosted version](/hosting/installation/npm/){:target="_blank" .external}, [n8n.cloud](/hosting/installation/cloud/){:target="_blank" .external}, or the [desktop app](/hosting/installation/desktop-app/){:target="_blank" .external}.

## How long does the course take?

Completing the course should take around **two hours**. You do not have to complete it in one go, feel free to take breaks and resume whenever you are ready.
