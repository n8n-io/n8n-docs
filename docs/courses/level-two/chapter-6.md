# Test your knowledge

Congratulations, you finished the n8n Course Level 2!

You've learned a lot about workflow automation and built quite a complex business workflow. Why not showcase your skills?

You can test your knowledge by taking a **quiz**, which consists of questions about the theoretical concepts and workflows covered in this course.

- You need to have at least 80% correct answers to pass the quiz.
- You can take the quiz as many times as you want.
- There's no time limit on answering the quiz questions.
