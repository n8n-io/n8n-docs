# Level two: Introduction

Welcome to the **n8n Course Level 2**!


## Is this course right for me?

This course is for you if you:

- Want to automate somewhat complex business processes.
- Want to dive deeper into n8n after taking the [Level 1 course](/courses/level-one/index.md).

## What will I learn in this course?

The focus in this course is on working with data. You will learn how to:

- Use the data structure of n8n correctly.
- Process different data types (for example, XML, HTML, date, time, and binary data).
- Merge data from different sources (for example, a database, spreadsheet, or CRM).
- Use functions and JavaScript code in the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/index.md).
- Deal with error workflows and workflow errors.

You will learn all this by completing short practical exercises after the theoretical explanations and building a business workflow following instructions.

## What do I need to get started?

To follow along this course (at a comfortable pace) you will need the following:

- **n8n set up**: You can use the [self-hosted version](/hosting/installation/npm.md) or [n8n Cloud](/manage-cloud/overview.md).
- **A user ID**: [Sign up here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/HQoQ7nXg) to get your unique ID and other credentials you will need in this course (Level 2). If you're a Level 1 finisher, please sign up again as you'll get different credentials for the Level 2 workflows.
- **Basic n8n skills**: We strongly recommend taking the [Level 1 course](/courses/level-one/index.md) before this one.
- **Basic JavaScript understanding**

## How long does the course take?

Completing the course should take around **two hours**. You don't have to complete it in one go; feel free to take breaks and resume whenever you are ready.

## How do I complete the course?

There are two milestones in this course that test your knowledge of what you have learned in the lessons:

- [x] Building the [main workflow](/courses/level-two/chapter-5/chapter-5.0.md)
- [x] Passing the [quiz](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/r9hDbytg) at the end of the course

You can always **check your progress** throughout the course by entering your unique ID [here](https://internal.users.n8n.cloud/webhook/course-level-2/verify).

If you successfully complete the milestones above, you will get [**a badge and an avatar**](https://community.n8n.io/badges/105/completed-n8n-course-level-2) in your forum profile. You can then share your profile and course verification ID to showcase your n8n skills to others.
