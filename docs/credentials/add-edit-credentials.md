# Create and edit credentials

You can get to the credential modal by either: 

* Opening the left menu, then selecting **Credentials** > **Add credential**.
* Selecting **Create New** in the **Credential** dropdown in a node.

Once in the credential modal, enter the details required by your service. Refer to your service's page in the [credentials library](/integrations/builtin/credentials/) for guidance.

When you save a credential, n8n tests it to confirm it works.
