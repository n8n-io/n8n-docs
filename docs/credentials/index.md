# Credentials

[Credentials](/glossary.md#credential-n8n) are private pieces of information issued by apps and services to authenticate you as a user and allow you to connect and share information between the app or service and the n8n node.

Access the credentials UI by opening the left menu and selecting **Credentials**. n8n lists credentials you created on the **My credentials** tab. The **All credentials** tab shows all credentials you can use, included credentials shared with you by other users.

* [Create and edit credentials](/credentials/add-edit-credentials.md).
* Learn about [credential sharing](/credentials/credential-sharing.md).
* Find information on setting up credentials for your services in the [credentials library](/integrations/builtin/credentials/index.md).
