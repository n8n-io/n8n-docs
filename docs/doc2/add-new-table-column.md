DOC² offers the possibility to manually create columns for extracted documents. This is necessary when there is a need to manually map columns to rows (fields) on the extracted document. When this is necessary and how it works you will learn here: [Manual row selection](/doc2/doc2app/table-train/training-of-table-extraction/manual-row-selection/)

Import any document and open it. Navigate to the table extraction view like via the "LINE ITEMS" button:

![](/_images/doc2/image-26.png){ loading=lazy }

Activate the training mode.

Columns can be added manually using the following button.

In the window that opens, you can specify a name for the column to be generated. Furthermore, you can set whether it is an optional or a mandatory field. You can also specify whether the column is a field that contains text (column type STRING), that contains numerical values (column type AMOUNT) or that contains a date (column type DATE).

Once the column has been created by clicking on "PROCEED", it can be used for manual mappings ([](/doc2/doc2app/table-train/training-of-table-extraction/manual-row-selection/)[Manual row selection](/doc2/doc2app/table-train/training-of-table-extraction/manual-row-selection/)).
