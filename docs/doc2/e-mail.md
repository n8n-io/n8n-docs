### If you want to import documents from a specific email folder, here are the steps you need to take:

Your email folder could look like this

As you can see there is no email account for the import set up yet

Click on the Deactivated Button to open the Email import settings

The boxes for E-Mail and Password as well as the API Key might get automatically filled with your login information for Doc2 depending on your browser settings. Please empty the fields before continuing to enter the needed information for the E-Mail Import.

What you need to do is enter the protocol (IMAP or POP3), the encryption (SSL or TSL), server-name, port, a username e.g. "incoming invoices" as well as email address and password from which the document should going to be imported from.

This example is for a google email account:

!!! note "Important due to changes made by Google"
		You now need to set up 2-Factor Authentication and create an App-Password which you have to use here to make sure that the E-Mail import will work.
