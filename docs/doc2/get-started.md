Welcome to the Fellow OCR Engine API!

The purpose of our OCR Engine is the transformation of regular pdf documents into OCR'd PDF documents.

  
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) describes the conversion of handwritten, typed or printed documents into **machine-encoded text**. That allows you to make any type of unstructured content searchable and readable.

In this case we use the technology to enable Ephesoft Transact and our PlugIns to extract Metadata in a more efficient and intelligent way.

Our API will be available for you and in the following documentation, we will elaborate its functionalities, the installation process and everything you need to know about it.

Thank you for choosing our Services!
