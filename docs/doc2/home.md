After logging in with your user you are redirected to the DASHBOARD homepage of FLOW².

This is the main page and overview where you can find your documents recently accessed, recently created and your applied favorites. You can also find an overview of all important items in the left sidebar.

The left sidebar with buttons and selectors is for accessing:

- Documents
- File cabinets and indexes that serve structural classification (such as the folders in a computer's file manager).
- Tags, which are oriented to the workflow status.

In the system selection at the top right you will find the area for configuration.
