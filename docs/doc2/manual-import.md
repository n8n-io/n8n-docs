As soon as the files have been uploaded, they have the initial status "Running". During this time the upload is processed. Editing the file is not possible in this status. Depending on the size and complexity of the file, processing may take a while:

As soon as the file has been processed, it receives the status "Ready for validation". As soon as the document is in this status, validation can be started:
