DOC² offers the possibility to upload your master data. This has the advantage that an automatic mapping of e.g. supplier data from your ERP system can be made during the extraction of documents.

For example, the VAT number or supplier name extracted from the document can be used to identify the supplier data record from your ERP system (from the supplier data uploaded to DOC²).

For more detailed information please refer to the following documentation: [Master data validation](/doc2/doc2app/document-validation/master-data-validation/)

To upload master data to DOC², please navigate to the settings from the dashboard:

In the following view you can import the CSV file with all your data via drag and drop or via the button "BROWSE". Additionally you can define if your file contains semicolon or comma as separator. When you are done click on "SAVE" to apply your changes.
