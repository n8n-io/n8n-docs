Here you can define a custom name for the notification, select the document type and status as well as the time unit and enter the e-mail address of the person who should receive the corresponding notification.

<ins>The following status can be selected:</ins> 

* Ready For Validation
* Pending Approval
* Pending Second Approval

<ins>Time Units available include:</ins>

- Minutes
- Hours
- Days

The delay has to be set to a minimum of 5 minutes as the email server will need that much time to respond.

The email will be sent after the selected time duration, if document status remains unchanged.
