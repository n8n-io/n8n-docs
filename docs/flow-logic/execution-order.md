# Execution order in multi-branch workflows

n8n's node execution order depends on the version of n8n you're using:

* For workflows created before version 1.0: n8n executes the first node of each branch, then the second node of each branch, and so on.
* For workflows created in version 1.0 and above: executes each branch in turn, completing one branch before starting another. n8n orders the branches based on their position on the [canvas](/glossary.md#canvas-n8n), from topmost to bottommost. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost branch executes first.

You can change the execution order in your [workflow settings](/workflows/settings.md).
