# Sub-workflows

You can call one workflow from another workflow. This allows you to build modular, microservice-like workflows. It can also help if your workflow grows large enough to encounter [memory issues](/hosting/scaling/memory-errors.md). Creating sub-workflows uses the [Execute Workflow](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow.md) and [Execute Sub-workflow Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflowtrigger.md) nodes.

## Set up and use a sub-workflow

This section walks through setting up both the parent workflow and sub-workflow.

## Sub-workflow conversion

See [sub-workflow conversion](/workflows/subworkflow-conversion.md) for how to divide your existing workflows into sub-workflows.
