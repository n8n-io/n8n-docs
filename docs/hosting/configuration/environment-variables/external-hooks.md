You can define external hooks that n8n executes whenever a specific operation runs. Refer to [Backend hooks](/embed/configuration.md#backend-hooks) for examples of available hooks and [Hook files](/embed/configuration.md#backend-hook-files) for information on file formatting. 

| Variable | Type  | Description |

| `EXTERNAL_FRONTEND_HOOKS_URLS` | String | URLs to files containing frontend external hooks. Provide multiple URLs as a colon-separated list ("`:`"). |
