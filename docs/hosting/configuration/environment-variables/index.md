# Environment variables overview

This section lists the environment variables that you can use to change n8n's configuration settings when self-hosting n8n.

For the complete and most up-to-date list of all environment variables, see the full reference in the n8n docs repository: [Full environment variables index](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/tree/main/docs/hosting/configuration/environment-variables).

/// note | File-based configuration
You can provide a [configuration file](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods.md) for n8n. You can also append `_FILE` to certain variables to provide their configuration in a separate file.
