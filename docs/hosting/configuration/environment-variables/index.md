# Environment variables overview

This section lists the environment variables that you can use to change n8n's configuration settings when self-hosting n8n.

/// note | File-based configuration
You can provide a [configuration file](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods.md) for n8n. You can also append `_FILE` to certain variables to provide their configuration in a separate file.
