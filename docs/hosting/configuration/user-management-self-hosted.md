# Configure self-hosted n8n for user management

User management in n8n allows you to invite people to work in your n8n instance. 

This document describes how to configure your n8n instance to support user management, and the steps to start inviting users.

Refer to the main [User management](/user-management/index.md) guide for more information about usage, including:

* [Managing users](/user-management/manage-users.md)
* [Account types](/user-management/account-types.md)
* [Best practices](/user-management/best-practices.md)

For LDAP setup information, refer to [LDAP](/user-management/ldap.md).

For SAML setup information, refer to [SAML](/user-management/saml/index.md).

/// note | Basic auth and JWT removed
n8n removed support for basic auth and JWT in version 1.0.

## Setup

There are three stages to set up user management in n8n:

1. Configure your n8n instance to use your SMTP server.
2. Start n8n and follow the setup steps in the app.
3. Invite users.

### Step one: SMTP

n8n recommends setting up an SMTP server, for user invites and password resets. 

/// note | Optional from 0.210.1
From version 0.210.1 onward, this step is optional. You can choose to manually copy and send invite links instead of setting up SMTP. Note that if you skip this step, users can't reset passwords.
///
Get the following information from your SMTP provider:

* Server name
* SMTP username
* SMTP password
* SMTP sender name

To set up SMTP with n8n, configure the SMTP environment variables for your n8n instance. For information on how to set environment variables, refer to [Configuration](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods.md)

If you're not familiar with SMTP, this [blog post by SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/blog/what-is-an-smtp-server/) offers a short introduction, while [Wikipedia's Simple Mail Transfer Protocol article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol) provides more detailed technical background.
