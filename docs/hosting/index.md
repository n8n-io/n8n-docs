# Self-hosting n8n

This section provides guidance on setting up n8n for both the Enterprise and Community self-hosted editions. The Community edition is free, the Enterprise edition isn't. 

See [feature comparison](/choose-n8n.md#feature-comparison) for a list of available features. Visit the [Docker installation guide](/hosting/installation/docker.md) for information on installing n8n.
