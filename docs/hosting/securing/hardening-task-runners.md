# Hardening task runners

[Task runners](/hosting/configuration/task-runners.md) are responsible for executing code from the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/index.md). While Code node executions are secure, you can follow these recommendations to further harden your task runners.

## Run task runners as sidecars in external mode

To increase the isolation between the core n8n process and code in the Code node, run task runners in [external mode](/hosting/configuration/task-runners.md#setting-up-external-mode). External task runners launch as separate containers, providing a fully isolated environment to execute the JavaScript defined in the Code node.
