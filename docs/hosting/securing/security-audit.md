# Security audit

You can run a security audit on your n8n instance, to detect common security issues.

## Run an audit

You can run an audit using the CLI, the public API, or the n8n node.


### CLI

Run `n8n audit`.

### API

Make a `POST` call to the `/audit` endpoint. You must authenticate as the instance owner.

### n8n node

Add the [n8n node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8n.md) to your workflow. Select **Resource** > **Audit** and **Operation** > **Generate**.

## Report contents

The audit generates five risk reports:

### Credentials

This report shows:

* Credentials not used in a workflow.
* Credentials not used in an active workflow.
* Credentials not use in a recently active workflow.

### Database

This report shows:

* Expressions used in **Execute Query** fields in SQL nodes.
* Expressions used in **Query Parameters** fields in SQL nodes.
* Unused **Query Parameters** fields in SQL nodes.

### File system

This report lists nodes that interact with the file system.

### Nodes

This report shows:

* Official risky nodes. These are n8n built in nodes. You can use them to fetch and run any code on the host system, which exposes the instance to exploits. You can view the list in [n8n code | Audit constants](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/src/security-audit/constants.ts#L51){:target=_blank .external-link}, under `OFFICIAL_RISKY_NODE_TYPES`.
* Community nodes.
* Custom nodes.

### Instance

This report shows:

* Unprotected webhooks in the instance.
* Missing security settings
* If your instance is outdated.
