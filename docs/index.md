## About n8n

n8n (pronounced n-eight-n) helps you to connect any app with an API with any other, and manipulate its data with little or no code.

* Customizable: highly flexible workflows and the option to build custom nodes.
* Convenient: use the npm or Docker to try out n8n, or the Cloud hosting option if you want us to handle the infrastructure.
* Privacy-focused: self-host n8n for privacy and security.
