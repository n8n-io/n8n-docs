# App nodes library

This section provides information about n8n's App nodes.

App nodes integrate with specific external services and applications. The specific features differ from service to service, but some common examples include managing resources with [CRUD operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete), checking and updating statuses, sending and receiving messages, and converting data and documents.

App nodes may be triggers or actions depending on whether they start workflows or not, and many App nodes implement both functions.
