# Airtop node

Use the Airtop node to automate work in Airtop, and integrate Airtop with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Airtop features, enabling you to control a cloud-based web browser for tasks like querying, scraping, and interacting with web pages.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Airtop node supports, and links to more resources.

## Node reference

### Create a session and window

Create an Airtop browser session to get a **Session ID**, then use it to create a new browser window. After this, you can use any extraction or interaction operation.

### Extract content

Extract content from a web browser using these operations:

- **Query page**: Extract information from the current window.
- **Query page with pagination**: Extract information from pages with pagination or infinite scrolling.
- **Smart scrape page**: Get the window content as markdown.

Get JSON responses by using the **JSON Output Schema** parameter in query operations.

### Interacting with pages

Click, hover, or type on elements by describing the element you want to interact with.

### Terminate a session

End your session to save resources. Sessions are automatically terminated based on the **Idle Timeout** set in the **Create Session** operation or can be manually terminated using the **Terminate Session** operation.
