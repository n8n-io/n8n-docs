# Autopilot node

Use the Autopilot node to automate work in Autopilot, and integrate Autopilot with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Autopilot features, including creating, deleting, and updating contacts, as well as adding contacts to a list.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Autopilot node supports and links to more resources.

/// warning | Autopilot branding change
Autopilot has become Ortto. The Autopilot credentials and nodes are only compatible with Autopilot, not the new Ortto API.
///
/// note | Credentials
Refer to [Autopilot credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/autopilot.md) for guidance on setting up authentication.
