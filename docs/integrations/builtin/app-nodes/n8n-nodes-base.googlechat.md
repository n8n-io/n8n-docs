On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Google Chat node supports and links to more resources.

### Creating messages in threads
When creating a message you can either create it in the space (default) or decide to reply to a thread. To do that you have to add the additional parameter `Message Reply Option`, enable the option `JSON Parameters` and specify either `thread.threadKey` or `thread.name` in the json payload. When setting it to `Reply and fallback to new thread` and having the thread key or name provided, the Google API will create a message in that thread if found, else it will create the message in the space. With the option `Reply or fail` the Google API will fail and return an error if the provided thread could not be found. 
An example json payload can be found below. You have to provide either threadKey or name. 
```
{
  "text": {{ $json.answer.toJsonString() }},
  "thread": {
    "name": "spaces/{{ $json.space_id}}/threads/{{ $json.thread_id }}",
    "threadKey": "{{ $json.thread_id }}"
  }
}
```
