# Google Sheets

Use the Google Sheets node to automate work in Google Sheets, and integrate Google Sheets with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Google Sheets features, including creating, updating, deleting, appending, removing and getting documents. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Google Sheets node supports and links to more resources.

/// note | Credentials
Refer to [Google Sheets credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/index.md) for guidance on setting up authentication.

<!-- ## Examples
This example uses the Customer Datastore node to provide sample data to load into Google Sheets. It assumes you've already set up your [credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/index.md).	
	1. Set up a Google Sheet with two columns, `test1` and `test`. In `test1`, enter the names from the Customer Datastore node:  
	![The spreadsheet set up for testing](/_images/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/googlesheets/test-sheet-before.png)  
	2. Create the workflow: use the manual trigger, Customer Datastore, and Google Sheets nodes.  
	![The spreadsheet set up for testing](/_images/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/googlesheets/workflow.png)  
	3. Open the Customer Datastore node, enable **Return All**, then select **Execute step**.
	4. In the Google Sheets node, go through the steps above, using these settings:
		* Select **Update Row** as the **Operation**.
		* In **Column to Match On**, select `test1`.
		* For the first field of **Values to Update**, drag in the **name** from the input view.
		* For the second field of **Values to Update**, drag in the **email** from the input view.
	5. Select **Execute step**.
	6. View your spreadsheet. **test2** should now contain the email addresses that match to the names in the input data.
