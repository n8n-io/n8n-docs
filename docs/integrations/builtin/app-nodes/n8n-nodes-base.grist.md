# Grist node

Use the Grist node to automate work in Grist, and integrate Grist with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Grist features, including creating, updating, deleting, and reading rows in a table. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Grist node supports and links to more resources.

## Get the Row ID

To update or delete a particular record, you need the Row ID. There are two ways to get the Row ID:

**Create a Row ID column in Grist**

Create a new column in your Grist table with the formula `$id`.

**Use the Get All operation**

The **Get All** operation returns the Row ID of each record along with the fields.
 
You can get it with the expression `{{$node["GristNodeName"].json["id"]}}`.


## Filter records when using the Get All operation

- Select **Add Option** and select **Filter** from the dropdown list.
- You can add filters for any number of columns. The result will only include records which match all the columns.
- For each column, you can enter any number of values separated by commas. The result will include records which match any of the values for that column.
