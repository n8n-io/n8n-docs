## How to control which custom fields to fetch for a user

There are three different ways to control which custom fields to retrieve when getting a user's information. Use the **Custom Fields** parameter to select one of the following:

- **Don't Include**: Doesn't include any custom fields.
- **Custom**: Includes the custom fields from schemas in **Custom Schema Names or IDs**.
- **Include All**: Include all the fields associated with the user.

To include custom fields, follow these steps:

1. Select **Custom** from the **Custom Fields** dropdown list.
2. Select the schema names you want to include in the **Custom Schema Names or IDs** dropdown list.
