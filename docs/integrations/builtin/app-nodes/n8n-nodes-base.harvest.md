# Harvest node

Use the Harvest node to automate work in Harvest, and integrate Harvest with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Harvest features, including creating, updating, deleting, and getting clients, contacts, invoices, tasks, expenses, users, and projects. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Harvest node supports and links to more resources.
