Refer to the [official JQL documentation](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/expand-jira/jql) about Jira Query Language (JQL) to learn more about it.

## Fetch issues for a specific project

The **Get All** operation returns all the issues from Jira. To fetch issues for a particular project, you need to use Jira Query Language (JQL).

For example, if you want to receive all the issues of a project named `n8n`, you'd do something like this:

- Select **Get All** from the **Operation** dropdown list.
- Toggle **Return All** to true.
- Select **Add Option** and select **JQL**.
- Enter `project=n8n` in the **JQL** field.

This query will fetch all the issues in the project named `n8n`. Enter the name of your project instead of `n8n` to fetch all the issues for your project.
