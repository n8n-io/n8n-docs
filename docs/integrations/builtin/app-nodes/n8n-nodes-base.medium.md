# Medium node

Use the Medium node to automate work in Medium, and integrate Medium with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Medium features, including creating posts, and getting publications. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Medium node supports and links to more resources.

/// warning | Medium API no longer supported
Medium has stopped supporting the Medium API. The Medium node still appears within n8n, but you won't be able to configure new API keys to authenticate with.

Refer to [Medium credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/medium.md) for guidance on setting up existing API keys.
