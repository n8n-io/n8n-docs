# Microsoft Entra ID node

Use the Microsoft Entra ID node to automate work in Microsoft Entra ID and integrate Microsoft Entra ID with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Microsoft Entra ID features, which includes creating, getting, updating, and deleting users and groups, as well as adding users to and removing them from groups.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Microsoft Entra ID node supports, and links to more resources.

## Common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the Microsoft Entra ID node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Updating the Allow External Senders and Auto Subscribe New Members options fails

You can't update the **Allow External Senders** and **Auto Subscribe New Members** options directly after creating a new group. You must wait after creating a group before you can change the values of these options.

When designing workflows that use multiple Microsoft Entra ID nodes to first create groups and then update these options, add a [Wait](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait.md) node between the two operations. A Wait node configured to pause for at least two seconds allows time for the group to fully initialize. After the wait, the update operation can complete without erroring.
