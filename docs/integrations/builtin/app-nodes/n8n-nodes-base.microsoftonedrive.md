## Find the folder ID

To perform operations on folders, you need to supply the ID. You can find this:

* In the URL of the folder
* By searching for it using the node. You need to do this if using MS 365 (where OneDrive uses SharePoint behind the scenes):
	1. Select **Resource** > **Folder**.
	2. Select **Operation** > **Search**.
	3. In **Query**, enter the folder name.
	4. Select **Execute step**. n8n runs the query and returns data about the folder, including an `id` field containing the folder ID.
