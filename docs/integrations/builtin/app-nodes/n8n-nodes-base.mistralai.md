# Mistral AI node

Use the Mistral AI node to automate work in Mistral AI and integrate Mistral AI with other applications. n8n has built-in support for extracting text with various models, file types, and input methods.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Mistral AI node supports, and links to more resources.

## Node parameters

* **Resource**: The resource that Mistral AI should operate on. The current implementation supports the "Document" resource.
* **Operation**: The operation to perform:
	* **Extract Text**: Extracts text from a document or image using optical character recognition (OCR).
* **Model**: The model to use for the given operation. The current version requires the `mistral-ocr-latest` model.
* **Document Type**: The document format to process. Can be "Document" or "Image".
* **Input Type**: How to input the document:
	* **Binary Data**: Pass the document to this node as a binary field.
	* **URL**: Fetch the document from a given URL.
* **Input Binary Field**: When using the "Binary Data" input type, defines the name of the input binary field containing the file.
* **URL**: When using the "URL" input type, the URL of the document or image to process.

## Node options

* **Enable Batch Processing**: Whether to process multiple documents in the same API call. This may reduce your costs by bundling requests.
* **Batch Size**: When using "Enable Batch Processing", sets the maximum number of documents to process per batch.
* **Delete Files After Processing**: When using "Enable Batch Processing", whether to delete the files from Mistral Cloud after processing.
