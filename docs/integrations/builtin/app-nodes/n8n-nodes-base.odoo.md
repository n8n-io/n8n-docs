# Odoo node

Use the Odoo node to automate work in Odoo, and integrate Odoo with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Odoo features, including creating, updating, deleting, and getting contracts, resources, and opportunities. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Odoo node supports and links to more resources.

## Custom Resources

When calling a custom resource you are able to call any model in Odoo. The call is transformed into a JSON RPC call on the Odoo side of things. This is helpful to keep in mind when building the filters. 


### Adding a filter

Click **Add condition** after selecting **Custom Resource** from the **Resource** dropdown. These filters work well for discrete values. If there are values in your Odoo instance that are falsey or truthy then it might be better
to use a **Domain filter**.

### Using domain filters

The **Domain Filter** field is only available for **Custom Resource**. It takes a JSON object and passes it to Odoo's JSON RPC. Odoo converts this into a Python Tuple to filter the model on upon execution. Below is a table for some Odoo domains and how they would be entered in the string field of **Domain Filter** in the Odoo node on n8n.


| Odoo Domain Filter | n8n Odoo Domain Filter String |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `[("intended_use", "=", False)]` | `[["intended_use", "=", false]]` |
| `["&", ("detailed_type", "=", "product"), "&", ("type", "=", "product"), ("reduced_template_price", "!=", False)]` | `["&", ["detailed_type", "=", "product"], "&", ["type", "=", "product"], ["reduced_template_price", "!=", false]]` |

You can "convert" a tuple to a JSON object by copying the Python Tuple and running it with a simple Python script:

```python
import json

tuple = [("intended_use", "=", False)]
json.dumps(tuple)

# outputs: [["intended_use", "=", false]]
```
