# Telegram node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Telegram node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Add a bot to a Telegram channel

For a bot to send a message to a channel, you must add the bot to the channel. If you haven't added the bot to the channel, you'll see an error with a description like:
`Error: Forbidden: bot is not a participant of the channel`.

To add a bot to a channel:

1. In the Telegram app, access the target channel and select the channel name.
2. Label the channel name as **public channel**.
3. Select **Administrators** > **Add Admin**.
4. Search for the bot's username and select it.
5. Select the checkmark on the top-right corner to add the bot to the channel.

## Get the Chat ID

You can only use `@channelusername` on public channels. To interact with a Telegram group, you need that group's Chat ID.

There are three ways to get that ID:

1. From the Telegram Trigger: Use the [Telegram Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegramtrigger/index.md) node in your workflow to get a Chat ID. This node can trigger on different events and returns a Chat ID on successful execution.
2. From your web browser: Open Telegram in a web browser and open the group chat. The group's Chat ID is the series of digits behind the letter "g." Prefix your group Chat ID with a `-` when you enter it in n8n.
3. Invite Telegram's [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot){:target=_blank .external-link} to the group: Once you add it, the bot outputs a JSON file that includes a `chat` object. The `id` for that object is the group Chat ID. Then remove the RawDataBot from your group.

## Send more than 30 messages per second

The Telegram API has a [limitation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#broadcasting-to-users){:target=_blank .external-link} of sending only 30 messages per second. Follow these steps to send more than 30 messages:

1. **Loop Over Items node**: Use the [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches.md) node to get at most 30 chat IDs from your database.
2. **Telegram node**: Connect the Telegram node with the Loop Over Items node. Use the **Expression Editor** to select the Chat IDs from the Loop Over Items node.
3. **Code node**: Connect the [Code](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/index.md) node with the Telegram node. Use the Code node to wait for a few seconds before fetching the next batch of chat IDs. Connect this node with the Loop Over Items node.

You can also use this [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/772){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages

If you're using the node to [send Telegram messages](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/message-operations.md#send-message), the message automatically gets an n8n attribution appended to the end:

> This message was sent automatically with n8n

To remove this attribution:

1. In the node's **Additional Fields** section, select **Add Field**.
2. Select **Append n8n attribution**.
3. Turn the toggle off.

Refer to [Send Message additional fields](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/message-operations.md#send-message-additional-fields) for more information.
