## Specify a column's data type

To specify a column's data type, append the column name with `:type`, where `type` is the data type you want for the column. For example, if you want to specify the type `int` for the column **id** and type `text` for the column **name**, you can use the following snippet in the **Columns** field: `id:int,name:text`.
