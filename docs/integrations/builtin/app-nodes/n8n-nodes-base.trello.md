## Find the List ID

1. Open the Trello board that contains the list.
2. If the list doesn't have any cards, add a card to the list.
3. Open the card, add `.json` at the end of the URL, and press enter.
4. In the JSON file, you will see a field called `idList`.
5. Copy the contents of the `idList`field and paste it in the ***List ID** field in n8n.
