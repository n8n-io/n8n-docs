# Twist node

## Get the User ID

To get the User ID for a user:

1. Open the **Team** tab.
2. Select a user's avatar.
3. Copy the string of characters located after `/u/` in your Twist URL. This string is the User ID. For example, if the URL is `https://twist.com/a/4qw45/people/u/475370` the User ID is `475370`.
