# OpenAI Audio operations

Use this operation to generate an audio, or transcribe or translate a recording in OpenAI. Refer to [OpenAI](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/index.md) for more information on the OpenAI node itself.

## Generate Audio

Use this operation to create audio from a text prompt. 

Enter these parameters:

- **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [OpenAI credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai.md).
- **Resource**: Select **Audio**.
- **Operation**: Select **Generate Audio**.
- **Model**: Select the model you want to use to generate the audio. Refer to [TTS | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/tts){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
    - **TTS-1**: Use this to optimize for speed.
    - **TTS-1-HD**:	Use this to optimize for quality.
- **Text Input**: Enter the text to generate the audio for. The maximum length is 4096 characters.
- **Voice**: Select a voice to use when generating the audio. Listen to the previews of the voices in [Text to speech guide | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech/quickstart){:target=_blank .external-link}.

### Options

- **Response Format**: Select the format for the audio response. Choose from **MP3** (default), **OPUS**, **AAC**, **FLAC**, **WAV**, and **PCM**.
- **Audio Speed**: Enter the speed for the generated audio from a value from `0.25` to `4.0`. Defaults to `1`.
- **Put Output in Field**: Defaults to `data`. Enter the name of the output field to put the binary file data in. 

Refer to [Create speech | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/createSpeech){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information.

## Transcribe a Recording

Use this operation to transcribe audio into text. OpenAI API limits the size of the audio file to 25 MB. OpenAI will use the `whisper-1` model by default. 

Enter these parameters:

- **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [OpenAI credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai.md).
- **Resource**: Select **Audio**.
- **Operation**: Select **Transcribe a Recording**.
- **Input Data Field Name**: Defaults to `data`. Enter the name of the binary property that contains the audio file in one of these formats: `.flac`, `.mp3`, `.mp4`, `.mpeg`, `.mpga`, `.m4a`, `.ogg`, `.wav`, or `.webm`. 

### Options

- **Language of the Audio File**: Enter the language of the input audio in  [ISO-639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes){:target=_blank .external-link}. Use this option to improve accuracy and latency.
- **Output Randomness (Temperature)**: Defaults to `1.0`. Adjust the randomness of the response. The range is between `0.0` (deterministic) and `1.0` (maximum randomness). We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Top P)** but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around 0.7) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If they’re too chaotic or off-track, decrease it. 

Refer to [Create transcription | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/createTranscription){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information.

## Translate a Recording

Use this operation to translate audio into English. OpenAI API limits the size of the audio file to 25 MB. OpenAI will use the `whisper-1` model by default. 

Enter these parameters:

- **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [OpenAI credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai.md).
- **Resource**: Select **Audio**.
- **Operation**: Select **Translate a Recording**.
- **Input Data Field Name**: Defaults to `data`. Enter the name of the binary property that contains the audio file in one of these formats: `.flac`, `.mp3`, `.mp4`, `.mpeg`, `.mpga`, `.m4a`, `.ogg`, `.wav`, or `.webm`. 

### Options

- **Output Randomness (Temperature)**: Defaults to `1.0`. Adjust the randomness of the response. The range is between `0.0` (deterministic) and `1.0` (maximum randomness). We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Top P)** but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around 0.7) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If they’re too chaotic or off-track, decrease it.
