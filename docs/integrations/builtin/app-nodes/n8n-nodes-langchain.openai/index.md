# OpenAI node

Use the OpenAI node to automate work in OpenAI and integrate OpenAI with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of OpenAI features, including creating images and assistants, as well as chatting with models. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the OpenAI node supports and links to more resources.

/// note | OpenAI Assistant node
The OpenAI node replaces the OpenAI assistant node from version 1.29.0 on.
///

/// note | Credentials
Refer to [OpenAI credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai.md) for guidance on setting up authentication.

## Using tools with OpenAI assistants

Some operations allow you to connect tools. [Tools](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools/) act like addons that your AI can use to access extra context or resources.

Select the **Tools** connector to browse the available tools and add them.

Once you add a tool connection, the OpenAI node becomes a [root node](/glossary.md#root-node-n8n), allowing it to form a [cluster node](/glossary.md#cluster-node-n8n) with the tools [sub-nodes](/glossary.md#sub-node-n8n). See [Node types](/integrations/builtin/node-types.md#cluster-nodes) for more information on cluster nodes and root nodes.

### Operations that support tool connectors

- **Assistant**
	- [**Message an Assistant**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/assistant-operations.md#message-an-assistant)
- **Text**
	- [**Message a Model**](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/text-operations.md#message-a-model)
