# OpenAI Chat Model node

Use the OpenAI Chat Model node to use OpenAI's chat models with conversational [agents](/glossary.md#ai-agent).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the OpenAI Chat Model node and links to more resources.

## Node parameters

### Model

Select the model to use to generate the completion.

n8n dynamically loads models from OpenAI and you'll only see the models available to your account.

## Node options

Use these options to further refine the node's behavior.

### Base URL

Enter a URL here to override the default URL for the API.

### Frequency Penalty

Use this option to control the chances of the model repeating itself. Higher values reduce the chance of the model repeating itself.

### Maximum Number of Tokens

Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.

### Response Format

Choose **Text** or **JSON**. **JSON** ensures the model returns valid JSON.

### Presence Penalty

Use this option to control the chances of the model talking about new topics. Higher values increase the chance of the model talking about new topics.

### Sampling Temperature

Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.

### Timeout

Enter the maximum request time in milliseconds.

### Max Retries

Enter the maximum number of times to retry a request.

### Top P

Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.
