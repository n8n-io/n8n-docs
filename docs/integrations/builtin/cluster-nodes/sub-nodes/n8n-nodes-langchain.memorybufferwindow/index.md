# Simple Memory node

Use the Simple Memory node to [persist](/glossary.md#ai-memory) chat history in your workflow.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Simple Memory node supports, and links to more resources.

/// warning | Don't use this node if running n8n in queue mode
If your n8n instance uses [queue mode](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode.md), this node doesn't work in an active production workflow. This is because n8n can't guarantee that every call to Simple Memory will go to the same worker.
