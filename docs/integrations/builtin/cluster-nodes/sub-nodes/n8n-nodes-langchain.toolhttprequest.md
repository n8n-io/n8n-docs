# HTTP Request Tool node

/// warning | Legacy tool version
New instances of the HTTP Request tool node that you add to workflows use the standard [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) node as a tool. This page is describes the legacy, standalone HTTP Request tool node.

You can identify which tool version is in your workflow by checking if the node has an **Add option** property when you open the node on the canvas. If that button is present, you're using the new version, not the one described on this page.
///

The HTTP Request tool works just like the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) node, but it's designed to be used with an [AI agent](/glossary.md#ai-agent) as a tool to collect information from a website or API.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the HTTP Request node supports and links to more resources.

/// note | Credentials
Refer to [HTTP Request credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest.md) for guidance on setting up authentication.
