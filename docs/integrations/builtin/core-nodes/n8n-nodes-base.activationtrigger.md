# Activation Trigger node

The Activation Trigger node gets triggered when an event gets fired by n8n or a workflow.

/// warning
n8n has deprecated the Activation Trigger node and replaced it with two new nodes: the [n8n Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8ntrigger.md) and the [Workflow Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.workflowtrigger.md). For more details, check out the entry in the [breaking changes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md#01170) page.
///

/// note | Keep in mind
If you want to use the Activation Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.
///

The Activation Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Activation Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.

## Node parameters

- Events
    - **Activation**: Run when the workflow gets activated
    - **Start**: Run when n8n starts or restarts
    - **Update**: Run when the workflow gets saved while it's active
