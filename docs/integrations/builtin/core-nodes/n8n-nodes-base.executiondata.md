# Execution Data

Use this node to save metadata for workflow executions. You can then search by this data in the **Executions** list.

You can retrieve custom execution data during workflow execution using the Code node. Refer to [Custom executions data](/workflows/executions/custom-executions-data.md) for more information.

/// info | Feature availability
Available on Pro and Enterprise plans.

## Operations

* Save Execution Data for Search

## Data to Save

Add a **Saved Field** for each key/value pair of metadata you'd like to save.

## Limitations

The Execution Data node has the following restrictions when storing execution metadata:

* `key`: limited to 50 characters
* `value`: limited to 512 characters

If either the `key` or `value` exceed the above limitations, n8n truncates to their maximum length and outputs a log entry.
