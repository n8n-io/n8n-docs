# GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/){:target=_blank .external-link} is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data. Use the GraphQL node to query a GraphQL endpoint.

## Node parameters

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/ai-tools.md"

### Authentication

Select the type of authentication to use.

If you select anything other than **None**, the **Credential for <selected-auth-type>** parameter appears for you to select an existing or create a new authentication credential for that authentication type.

### HTTP Request Method

Select the underlying HTTP Request method the node should use. Choose from:

* **GET**
* **POST**: If you select this method, you'll also need to select the **Request Format** the node should use for the query payload. Choose from:
    * **GraphQL (Raw)**
    * **JSON**

### Endpoint

Enter the GraphQL Endpoint you'd like to hit.

### Ignore SSL Issues

When you turn on this control, n8n ignores SSL certificate validation failure.

### Query

Enter the GraphQL query you want to execute.

Refer to [Related Resources](#related-resources) for information on writing your query.

### Response Format

Select the format you'd like to receive query results in. Choose between:

* **JSON**
* **String**: If you select this format, enter a **Response Data Property Name** to define the property the string is written to.

## Headers

Enter any **Headers** you want to pass as part of the query as **Name** / **Value** pairs.
