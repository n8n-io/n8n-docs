# Local File Trigger node

The Local File Trigger node starts a workflow when it detects changes on the file system. These changes involve a file or folder getting added, changed, or deleted.

/// note | Self-hosted n8n only
This node isn't available on n8n Cloud.
///

## Node parameters

You can choose what event to watch for using the **Trigger On** parameter.

## Changes to a Specific File

The node triggers when the specified file changes.

Enter the path for the file to watch in **File to Watch**.

## Changes Involving a Specific Folder

The node triggers when a change occurs in the selected folder.

Configure these parameters:

- **Folder to Watch**: Enter the path of the folder to watch.
- **Watch for**: Select the type of change to watch for.


## Node options

Use the node **Options** to include or exclude files and folders.

- **Include Linked Files/Folders**: also watch for changes to linked files or folders.
- **Ignore**: files or paths to ignore. n8n tests the whole path, not just the filename. Supports the [Anymatch](https://github.com/micromatch/anymatch){:target=_blank .external-link} syntax.
- **Max Folder Depth**: how deep into the folder structure to watch for changes.

### Examples for Ignore

Ignore a single file:

```sh
**/<fileName>.<suffix>
# For example, **/myfile.txt
```

Ignore a sub-directory of a directory you're watching:

```sh
**/<directoryName>/**
# For example, **/myDirectory/**
```
