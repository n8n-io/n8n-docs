# Manual trigger

Use this node if you want to start a workflow by selecting **Test Workflow**, and don't want any option for the workflow to run automatically.

Workflows always need a trigger (start point). In most cases, a trigger node starts the workflow in response to an external event. However, you still need a trigger node even when starting the workflow manually.

/// note | Examples and templates
For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Manual Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/manual-trigger/){:target=_blank .external-link} page.
