# n8n

A node to integrate with n8n itself. This node allows you to consume the [n8n API](/api/index.md) in your workflows.

Refer to the [n8n REST API documentation](/api/index.md) for more information on using the n8n API. Refer to [API endpoint reference](/api/api-reference.md) for working with the API endpoints directly.

/// note | Credentials
You can find authentication information for this node in the [API authentication](/api/authentication.md) documentation.
///

/// warning | SSL
This node doesn't support SSL. If your server requires an SSL connection, use the [HTTP Request node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) to call the [n8n API](/api/index.md).
The HTTP Request node has options to [provide the SSL certificate](/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest.md#provide-an-ssl-certificate).
