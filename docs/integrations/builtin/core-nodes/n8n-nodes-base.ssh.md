# SSH

The SSH node is useful for executing commands using the Secure Shell Protocol.

/// note | Credentials
You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ssh.md).
///

## Operations

- [**Execute** a command](#execute-command)
- [**Download** a file](#download-file)
- [**Upload** a file](#upload-file)

/// note | Uploading files
To attach a file for upload, you will need to use an extra node such as the [Read/Write Files from Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile.md) node or the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) node to pass the file as a data property.
///

Configure this operation with these parameters:

- **Credential to connect with**: Select an existing or create a new [SSH credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ssh.md) to connect with.
- **Command**: Enter the command to execute on the remote device.
- **Working Directory**: Enter the directory where n8n should execute the command.

### Download File

- **Credential to connect with**: Select an existing or create a new [SSH credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ssh.md) to connect with.
