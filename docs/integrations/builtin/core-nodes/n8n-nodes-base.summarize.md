# Summarize

Use the Summarize node to aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.

## Node parameters

### Fields to Summarize

Use these fields to define how you want to summarize your input data.

* **Aggregation**: Select the aggregation method to use on a given field. Options include:
	* **Append**: Append 
		* If you select this option, decide whether you want to **Include Empty Values** or not.
	* **Average**: Calculate the numeric average of your input data.
	* **Concatenate**: Combine together values in your input data.
		* If you select this option, decide whether you want to **Include Empty Values** or not.
		* **Separator**: Select the separator you want to insert between concatenated values.
	* **Count**: Count the total number of values in your input data.
	* **Count Unique**: Count the number of unique values in your input data.
	* **Max**: Find the highest numeric value in your input data.
	* **Min**: Find the lowest numeric value in your input data.
	* **Sum**: Add together the numeric values in your input data.
* **Field**: Enter the name of the field you want to perform the aggregation on.

### Fields to Split By

Enter the name of the input fields that you want to split the summary by (similar to a group by statement). This allows you to get separate summaries based on values in other fields.

For example, if our input data contains columns for `Sales Rep` and `Deal Amount` and we're performing a **Sum** on the `Deal Amount` field, we could split by `Sales Rep` to get a **Sum** total for each Sales Rep.

To enter multiple fields to split by, enter a comma-separated list.

## Node options

### Continue if Field Not Found

By default, if a **Field to Summarize** isn't in any items, the node throws an error. Use this option to continue and return a single empty item (turned on) instead or keep the default error behavior (turned off).

### Disable Dot Notation

By default, n8n enables dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child`. Use this option to disable dot notation (turned on) or to continue using dot (turned off).

### Output Format

Select the format for your output format. This option is recommended if you're using **Fields to Split By**

* **Each Split in a Separate Item**: Use this option to generate a separate output item for each split out field.
* **All Splits in a Single Item**: Use this option to generate a single item that lists the split out fields.

## Ignore items without valid fields to group by

Set whether to ignore input items that don't contain the **Fields to Split By** (turned on) or not (turned off).
