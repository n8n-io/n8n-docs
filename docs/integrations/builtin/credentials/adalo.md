## Related resources

Refer to [Adalo's API collections documentation](https://help.adalo.com/integrations/the-adalo-api/collections){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about working with the service.

## Using API key

To configure this credential, you'll need an [Adalo](https://www.adalo.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account and:

- An **API Key**
- An **App ID**

To get these, create an Adalo app:

1. From the app dropdown in the top navigation, select **CREATE NEW APP**.
1. Select the App Layout type that makes sense for you and select **Next**.
    - If you're new to using the product, Adalo recommend using **Mobile Only**.
1. Select a template to get started with or select **Blank**, then select **Next**.
1. Enter an **App Name**, like `n8n integration`.
1. If applicable, select the **Team** for the app.
1. Select branding colors.
1. Select **Create**. The app editor opens.
1. In the left menu, select **Settings** (the gear cog icon).
1. Select **App Access**.
1. In the **API Key** section, select **Generate Key**.
    - If you don't have the correct plan level, you'll see a prompt to upgrade instead.
1. Copy the key and enter it as the **API Key** in your n8n credential.
1. The URL includes the **App ID** after `https://app.adalo.com/apps/`. For example, if the URL for your app is `https://app.adalo.com/apps/b78bdfcf-48dc-4550-a474-dd52c19fc371/app-settings`, `b78bdfcf-48dc-4550-a474-dd52c19fc371` is the App ID. Copy this value and enter it in your n8n credential.
