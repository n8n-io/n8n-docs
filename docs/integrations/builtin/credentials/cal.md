# Cal credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes with Cal.

- [Cal Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.caltrigger/)

## Prerequisites

Create a [Cal](https://www.cal.com/) pro account.

## Using API keys

Your API requests are authenticated using API keys. Any request that doesn't include an API key will return an error.

1. Log into your Cal account.
2. Click on **Settings**.
3. There you will find the API keys section which allows you to generate a key for use. More information on this can be found on the [Cal Authentication](https://developer.cal.com/api/authentication){:target=_blank} page.
4. Use API key in your Cal trigger node credentials in n8n.
