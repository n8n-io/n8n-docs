# Webex by Cisco credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Webex by Cisco](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.ciscowebex.md)
- [Webex by Cisco Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.ciscowebextrigger.md)

## Prerequisites

Create a [Webex by Cisco](https://www.webex.com/) account (this should automatically get you [developer account access](https://developer.webex.com){:target=_blank .external-link}).

## Supported authentication methods

- OAuth2

## Related resources

Refer to [Webex's API documentation](https://developer.webex.com/docs/getting-started){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using OAuth2

/// note | Note for n8n Cloud users
You'll only need to enter the Credentials Name and select the **Connect my account** button in the OAuth credential to connect your Webex by Cisco account to n8n.
///

Should you need to configure OAuth2 from scratch, you'll need to create an integration to use this credential. Refer to the instructions in the [Webex Registering your Integration documentation](https://developer.webex.com/docs/integrations#registering-your-integration){:target=_blank .external-link} to begin.

n8n recommends using the following **Scopes** for your integration:

* `spark:rooms_read`
* `spark:messages_write`
* `spark:messages_read`
* `spark:memberships_read`
* `spark:memberships_write`
* `meeting:recordings_write`
* `meeting:recordings_read`
* `meeting:preferences_read`
* `meeting:schedules_write`
* `meeting:schedules_read`
