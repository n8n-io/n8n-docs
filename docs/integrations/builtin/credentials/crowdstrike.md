## Authentication methods

Refer to CrowdStrike's documentation for more information about the service. Their documentation is behind a log in, so you must log in to your account on their website to access the API documentation.

This is a credential-only node. Refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/custom-operations.md) to learn more. View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/crowdstrike/){:target=_blank .external-link} on n8n's website.

## Using OAuth2

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- The **URL** of your CrowdStrike instance
- A **Client ID**: Generated by creating a new API Client in Crowdstrike in **Support > API Clients and Keys**.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated by creating a new API Client in Crowdstrike in **Support > API Clients and Keys**.

A broad outline of the appropriate steps is available publicly at the CrowdStrike blog: [Getting Access to the CrowdStrike API](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/tech-center/get-access-falcon-apis/){:target=_blank .external-link}.
