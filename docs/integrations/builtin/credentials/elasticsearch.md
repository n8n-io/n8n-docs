# Elasticsearch credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Elasticsearch](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.elasticsearch.md)

## Supported authentication methods

- Basic auth

## Related resources

Refer to [Elasticsearch's documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using basic auth

To configure this credential, you'll need an [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/){:target=_blank .external-link} account with a [deployment](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-create-deployment.html){:target=_blank .external-link} and:

- A **Username**
- A **Password**
- Your Elasticsearch application's **Base URL** (also known as the Elasticsearch application endpoint)

To set up the credential:

1. Enter your Elasticsearch **Username**.
2. Enter your Elasticsearch **Password**.
3. In Elasticsearch, go to **Deployments**.
4. Select your deployment.
5. Select **Manage this deployment**.
6. In the **Applications** section, copy the endpoint of the **Elasticsearch** application.
7. Enter this in n8n as the **Base URL**.
8. By default, n8n connects only if SSL certificate validation succeeds. If you'd like to connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.

/// note | Custom endpoint aliases
If you add a [custom endpoint alias](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-regional-deployment-aliases.html){:target=_blank .external-link} to a deployment, update your n8n credential **Base URL** with the new endpoint.
