# Google: OAuth2 single service

This document contains instructions for creating a Google credential for a single service. They're also available as a [video](#video).

## Set up OAuth

You need a [Google Cloud Platform project](https://developers.google.com/workspace/marketplace/create-gcp-project){:targe=_blank .external-link} for these steps.

In Google Cloud:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console | APIs and services](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials){:target=_blank .external-link} and make sure you're in the project you want to use.

2. **Optional:** If you haven't used OAuth in your Google Cloud project before, you need to [configure the OAuth consent screen](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent){:target=_blank .external-link}. Expand the detailed steps below for more guidance.

	??? Details "View detailed steps"
		1. Select **OAuth consent screen**.
		2. For **User Type**, select **Internal**.
		3. Select **Create**.
		4. Enter the essential information: **App name**, **User support email**, and the **Email addresses** field in **Developer contact information**.
		5. Add an authorized domain: select **+ ADD DOMAIN**. Enter `n8n.cloud` if using n8n's Cloud service, or the domain of your n8n instance if you're self-hosting.
		6. Select **SAVE AND CONTINUE** to go to the **Scopes** page.
		7. You don't need to set any scopes. Select **SAVE AND CONTINUE** again to go to the **Summary** page.
		8. On the **Summary** page, review the information, then select **BACK TO DASHBOARD**.

3. Select **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS > OAuth client ID**.

		![Add URI](/_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/add-uri.png)

6. Select **CREATE**.
7. Enable each Google service API that you want to use:

	1. If using Google Perspective or Google Ads: [Request API Access for Perspective](https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-get-started){:targe=_blank .external-link} or a [Developer Token for Ads](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/dev-token){:targe=_blank .external-link}.

In n8n:

1. Enter your new **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Google Cloud Console in the credentials modal.
2. Select **Sign in with Google** to complete your Google authentication.
3. **Save** your new credentials.

## Troubleshooting

### Google hasn't verified this app

If using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning **Google hasn't verified this app**. To avoid this, you can create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate. However, if you're using credentials that were generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), do the following in Google Cloud:

1. Select **Advanced**.
2. Select **Go to CREDENTIALS_NAME (unsafe)**. `CREDENTIALS_NAME` is the name of the credentials created by the third party.
3. Grant the requested permissions.

### Google Cloud app becoming unauthorized

For Google Cloud apps with **Publishing status** set to **Testing** and **User type** set to **External**, consent and tokens expire after seven days. Refer to [Google Cloud Platform Console Help | Setting up your OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615?hl=en#zippy=%2Ctesting){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information. To resolve this, reconnect the app in the n8n credentials modal.
