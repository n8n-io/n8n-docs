## Using API key

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/){:target=_blank .external-link} account and:

- An **API Key**: Hugging Face calls these API tokens.

To get your API token:

1. Open your Hugging Face profile and go to the [**Tokens**](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens){:target=_blank .external-link} section.
2. Copy the token listed there. It should begin with `hf_`.
3. Enter this API token as your n8n credential **API Key**.

Refer to [Get your API token](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/quicktour#get-your-api-token){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
