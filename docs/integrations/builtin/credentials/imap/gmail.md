# Gmail IMAP credentials

Follow these steps to configure the IMAP credentials with a Gmail account.

## Prerequisites

To follow these instructions, you must first:

1. [Enable 2-step Verification](#enable-2-step-verification) on your Gmail account.
2. [Generate an app password](#generate-an-app-password).

### Enable 2-step Verification

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/email/gmail-two-step-verification.md"

### Generate an app password

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/email/gmail-app-password.md"

## Set up the credential

To set up the IMAP credential with a Gmail account, use these settings:

1. Enter your Gmail email address as the **User**.
2. Enter the app password you generated above as the **Password**.
3. Enter `imap.gmail.com` as the **Host**.
4. For the **Port**, keep the default port number of `993`. Check with your email administrator if this port doesn't work.
5. Turn on the **SSL/TLS** toggle.
6. Check with your email administrator about whether to **Allow Self-Signed Certificates**.

Refer to [Add Gmail to another client](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229?hl=en){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information. You may need to **Enable IMAP** if you're using a personal Google account before June 2024.
