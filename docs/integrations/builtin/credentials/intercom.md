# Intercom credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Intercom](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.intercom.md)


## Prerequisites

- Create an [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) developer account.
- [Create an app](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/build-an-integration/learn-more/authentication/) in your developer hub.

## Supported authentication methods

- API key

## Related resources

Refer to [Intercom's API documentation](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/references/introduction/) for more information about the service.

## Using API key

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **API Key**: Intercom automatically generates an **Access Token** when you [create an app](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/build-an-integration/learn-more/authentication/). Use this **Access Token** as your n8n **API Key**. Refer to [How to get your Access Token](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/build-an-integration/learn-more/authentication/#how-to-get-your-access-token) for more detailed instructions.
