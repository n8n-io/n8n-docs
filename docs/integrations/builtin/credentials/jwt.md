# JWT credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [JWT](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.jwt.md)
- [Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/index.md)

## Supported authentication methods

- Passphrase: Signed with a secret with HMAC algorithm
- Private key (PEM key): For use with [Private Key JWT](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authenticate-with-private-key-jwt){:target=_blank .external-link} with RSA or ECDSA algorithm

## Related resources

Refer to the [JSON Web Token spec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519){:target=_blank .external-link} for more details.

For a more verbose introduction, refer to the [JWT website Introduction to JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction){:target=_blank .external-link}. Refer to [JSON Web Token (JWT) Signing Algorithms Overview](https://auth0.com/blog/json-web-token-signing-algorithms-overview/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on selecting between the two types and the algorithms involved.

## Using Passphrase

To configure this credential:

1. Select the **Key Type** of **Passphrase**.
2. Enter the Passphrase **Secret**
3. Select the **Algorithm** used to sign the assertion. Refer to [Available algorithms](#available-algorithms) below for a list of supported algorithms.

## Using private key (PEM key)

To configure this credential:
1. Select the **Key Type** of **PEM Key**.
2. A **Private Key**: Obtained from generating a Key Pair. Refer to [Generate RSA Key Pair](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/application-credentials/generate-rsa-key-pair){:target=_blank .external-link} for an example.
3. A **Public Key**: Obtained from generating a Key Pair. Refer to [Generate RSA Key Pair](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/application-credentials/generate-rsa-key-pair){:target=_blank .external-link} for an example.
4. Select the **Algorithm** used to sign the assertion. Refer to [Available algorithms](#available-algorithms) below for a list of supported algorithms.
