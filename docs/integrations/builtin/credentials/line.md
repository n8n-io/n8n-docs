## Using Notify OAuth2

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Line](https://line.me/en/){:target=_blank .external-link} account and:

- A **Client ID**
- A **Client Secret**

To generate both, connect Line with [Line Notify](https://notify-bot.line.me/en/){:target=_blank .external-link}. Then:

1. Open the Line Notify page to [add a new service](https://notify-bot.line.me/my/services/new){:target=_blank .external-link}.
1. Enter a **Service name**. This name displays when someone tries to connect to the service.
1. Enter a **Service description**.
1. Enter a **Service URL**
1. Enter your **Company/Enterprise**.
1. Select your **Country/region**.
1. Enter your name or team name as the **Representative**.
1. Enter a valid **Email address**. Line will verify this email address before the service is fully registered. Use an email address you have ready access to.
1. Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from your n8n credential and enter it as the **Callback URL** in Line Notify.
1. Select **Agree and continue** to agree to the terms of service.
1. Verify the information you entered is correct and select **Add**.
1. Check your email and open the Line Notify Registration URL to verify your email address.
1. Once verification is complete, open [**My services**](https://notify-bot.line.me/my/services/){:target=_blank .external-link}.
1. Select the service you just added.
1. Copy the **Client ID** and enter it in your n8n credential.
1. Select the option to **Display** the **Client Secret**. Copy the **Client Secret** and enter it in your n8n credential.
1. In n8n, select **Connect my account** and follow the on-screen prompts to finish the credential.
