# MailerLite credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [MailerLite](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mailerlite/)
- [MailerLite Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mailerlitetrigger/)

## Prerequisites

Create a [MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account.

## Supported authentication methods

- API key

## Related resources

Refer to [MailerLite's API documentation](https://developers.mailerlite.com/docs/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API key

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **API Key**: Generate an API key from the **Integrations** menu. Refer to the [API Authentication documentation](https://developers.mailerlite.com/docs/#authentication){:target=_blank .external-link} for more detailed instructions.

Enable the **Classic API** toggle if the API key is for a MailerLite Classic account instead of the newer MailerLite experience.

/// note
Most new MailerLite accounts and all free accounts should disable the **Classic API** toggle. You can find out [which version of MailerLite you are using](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/which-version-of-mailerlite-am-i-using) and learn more about the differences between the two in the [MailerLite FAQ](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/new-mailerlite-faq).
