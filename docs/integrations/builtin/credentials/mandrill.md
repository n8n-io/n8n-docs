# Mandrill credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

## Prerequisites

- Create a Mailchimp [Transactional email account](https://mailchimp.com/features/transactional-email-infrastructure/) 
- Log in to [Mandrill](https://mandrillapp.com/login/) with your Mailchimp account.

If you already have a Mailchimp account with a Standard plan or higher, enable [Transactional Emails](https://mailchimp.com/help/add-or-remove-transactional-email) within that account to use Mandrill.

## Supported authentication methods

- API key

## Related resources

Refer to [Mailchimp's Transactional API documentation](https://mailchimp.com/developer/transactional/api/) for more information about the service.

## Using API key

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **API Key**: Generate an API key from the Mandrill [Settings](https://mandrillapp.com/settings). Refer to Mailchimp's [Generate your API key documentation](https://mailchimp.com/developer/transactional/guides/quick-start/#generate-your-api-key) for more detailed instructions.
