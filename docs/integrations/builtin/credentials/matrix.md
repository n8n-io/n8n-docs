# Matrix credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Matrix](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.matrix.md)

## Prerequisites

Create an account on a [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) server. Refer to [Creating an account](https://matrix.org/docs/chat_basics/matrix-for-im/#creating-a-matrix-account) for more information.

## Supported authentication methods

- API access token

## Related resources

Refer to the [Matrix Specification](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/) for more information about the service.

Refer to the documentation for the specific client you're using to access the Matrix server.

## Using API access token

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **Access Token**: This token is tied to the account you use to log into Matrix with.
- A **Homeserver URL**: This is the URL of the [homeserver](https://matrix.org/docs/matrix-concepts/elements-of-matrix/#homeserver) you entered when you created your account. n8n prepopulates this with matrix.org's own server; adjust this if you're using a server hosted elsewhere.

Instructions for getting these details vary depending on the client you're using to access the server. Both the **Access Token** and the **Homeserver URL** can most commonly be found in **Settings > Help & About > Advanced**, but refer to your client's documentation for more details.
