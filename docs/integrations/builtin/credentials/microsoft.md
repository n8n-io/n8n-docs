# Microsoft credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Microsoft Dynamics CRM](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftdynamicscrm.md)
- [Microsoft Excel](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftexcel.md)
- [Microsoft Graph Security](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftgraphsecurity.md)
- [Microsoft OneDrive](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftonedrive.md)
- [Microsoft Outlook](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftoutlook.md)
- [Microsoft SharePoint](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftsharepoint.md)
- [Microsoft Teams](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftteams.md)
- [Microsoft Teams Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftteamstrigger.md)
- [Microsoft To Do](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsofttodo.md)

## Prerequisites

- Create a [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account.
- Create at least one user account with access to the appropriate service.
- If the user account is managed by a corporate Microsoft Entra account, the administrator account has enabled the option “User can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf” for this user (see the [Microsoft Entra documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/grant-admin-consent)).

## Supported authentication methods

- OAuth2

## Using OAuth2

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/cloud-oauth-button.md"

Some Microsoft services require extra information for OAuth2. Refer to [Service-specific settings](#service-specific-settings) for more guidance on those services.

For self-hosted users, there are two main steps to configure OAuth2 from scratch:

1. [Register an application](#register-an-application) with the Microsoft Identity Platform.
2. [Generate a client secret](#generate-a-client-secret) for that application.

Follow the detailed instructions for each step below. For more detail on the Microsoft OAuth2 web flow, refer to [Microsoft authentication and authorization basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts){:target=_blank .external-link}. 

### Register an application

Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform:

1. Open the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://aka.ms/appregistrations){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. Select **Register an application**.
3. Enter a **Name** for your app.
4. In **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multi-tenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (for example, Skype, Xbox)**.
5. In **Register an application**:
    1. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from your n8n credential.
    2. Paste it into the **Redirect URI (optional)** field.
    3. Select **Select a platform** > **Web**.
6. Select **Register** to finish creating your application.
7. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and paste it into n8n as the **Client ID**.

Refer to [Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

### Generate a client secret

With your application created, generate a client secret for it:

1. On your Microsoft application page, select **Certificates & secrets** in the left navigation.
1. In **Client secrets**, select **+ New client secret**.
1. Enter a **Description** for your client secret, such as `n8n credential`.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Copy the **Secret** in the **Value** column.
1. Paste it into n8n as the **Client Secret**.
1. If you see other fields in the n8n credential, refer to [Service-specific settings](#service-specific-settings) below for guidance on completing those fields.
1. Select **Connect my account** in n8n to finish setting up the connection.
1. Log in to your Microsoft account and allow the app to access your info.

Refer to Microsoft's [Add credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#add-credentials){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on adding a client secret.

### Service-specific settings

The following services require extra information for OAuth2:

#### Dynamics

Dynamics OAuth2 requires information about your Dynamics domain and region. Follow these extra steps to complete the credential:

1. Enter your Dynamics **Domain**.
2. Select the Dynamics data center **Region** you're within.

Refer to the [Microsoft Datacenter regions documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/new-datacenter-regions){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on the region options and corresponding URLs.

#### Microsoft (general)

The general Microsoft OAuth2 also requires you to provide a space-separated list of **Scope**s for this credential.

Refer to [Scopes and permissions in the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc){:target=_blank .external-link} for a list of possible scopes.

#### Outlook

Outlook OAuth2 supports the credential accessing a user's primary email inbox or a shared inbox. By default, the credential will access a user's primary email inbox. To change this behavior:

1. Turn on **Use Shared Inbox**.
2. Enter the target user's UPN or ID as the **User Principal Name**.

#### SharePoint

SharePoint OAuth2 requires information about your SharePoint **Subdomain**.

To complete the credential, enter the **Subdomain** part of your SharePoint URL. For example, if your SharePoint URL is `https://tenant123.sharepoint.com`, the subdomain is `tenant123`.

## Common issues

Here are the known common errors and issues with Microsoft OAuth2 credentials.
