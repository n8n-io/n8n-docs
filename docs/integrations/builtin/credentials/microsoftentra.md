# Microsoft Entra ID credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [Microsoft Entra ID](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftentra.md)

## Prerequisites

- Create a Microsoft Entra ID account or subscription.
- If the user account is managed by a corporate Microsoft Entra account, the administrator account has enabled the option “User can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf” for this user (see the [Microsoft Entra documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/grant-admin-consent)).

Microsoft includes an Entra ID free plan when you create a [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) account.

## Supported authentication methods

- OAuth2

## Related resources

Refer to [Microsoft Entra ID's documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/azure-active-directory) for more information about the service.

## Using OAuth2

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/cloud-oauth-button.md"

For self-hosted users, there are two main steps to configure OAuth2 from scratch:

1. [Register an application](#register-an-application) with the Microsoft Identity Platform.
2. [Generate a client secret](#generate-a-client-secret) for that application.

Follow the detailed instructions for each step below. For more detail on the Microsoft OAuth2 web flow, refer to [Microsoft authentication and authorization basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). 

### Register an application

Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform:

1. Open the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://aka.ms/appregistrations).
2. Select **Register an application**.
3. Enter a **Name** for your app.
4. In **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multi-tenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (for example, Skype, Xbox)**.
5. In **Register an application**:
    1. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from your n8n credential.
    2. Paste it into the **Redirect URI (optional)** field.
    3. Select **Select a platform** > **Web**.
6. Select **Register** to finish creating your application.
7. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and paste it into n8n as the **Client ID**.

Refer to [Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2) for more information.

### Generate a client secret

With your application created, generate a client secret for it:

1. On your Microsoft application page, select **Certificates & secrets** in the left navigation.
1. In **Client secrets**, select **+ New client secret**.
1. Enter a **Description** for your client secret, such as `n8n credential`.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Copy the **Secret** in the **Value** column.
1. Paste it into n8n as the **Client Secret**.
1. Select **Connect my account** in n8n to finish setting up the connection.
1. Log in to your Microsoft account and allow the app to access your info.

Refer to Microsoft's [Add credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#add-credentials) for more information on adding a client secret.

## Setting custom scopes

Microsoft Entra ID credentials use the following scopes by default:

* [`openid`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc#the-openid-scope)
* [`offline_access`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc#the-offline_access-scope)
* [`AccessReview.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#accessreviewreadwriteall)
* [`Directory.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#directoryreadwriteall)
* [`NetworkAccessPolicy.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#networkaccesspolicyreadwriteall)
* [`DelegatedAdminRelationship.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#delegatedadminrelationshipreadwriteall)
* [`EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#entitlementmanagementreadwriteall)

* [`GroupMember.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#groupmemberreadwriteall)

To select different scopes for your credentials, enable the **Custom Scopes** slider and edit the **Enabled Scopes** list. Keep in mind that some features may not work as expected with more restrictive scopes.
