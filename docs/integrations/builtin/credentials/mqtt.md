# MQTT credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes with MQTT.

- [MQTT](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mqtt/)
- [MQTT Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mqtttrigger/)

## Prerequisites

You need to have a MQTT broker installed.

## Using MQTT

Use your Protocol, Host, Port, Username, and Password as the MQTT Trigger credential data in n8n.

Optionally, you can enable SSL and provide a CA or Client certificate.
