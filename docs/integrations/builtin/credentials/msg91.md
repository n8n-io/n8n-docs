# MSG91 credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [MSG91](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.msg91.md)

## Prerequisites

Create a [MSG91](https://msg91.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account.

## Supported authentication methods

- API key

## Related resources

Refer to [MSG91's API documentation](https://docs.msg91.com/overview){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API key

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **Authentication Key**: To get your Authentication Key, go to the user menu and select **Authkey**. Refer to MSG91's [Where can I find my authentication key? documentation](https://msg91.com/help/where-can-i-find-my-authentication-key){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

## IP Security

MSG91 enables [IP Security](https://msg91.com/help/what-do-you-mean-by-api-security){:target=_blank .external-link} by default for authkeys.

For the n8n credentials to function with this setting enabled, add all the [n8n IP addresses](/manage-cloud/cloud-ip.md) as whitelisted IPs in MSG91. You can add them in one of two places, depending on your desired security level:

- To allow any/all authkeys in the account to work with n8n, add the n8n IP addresses in the **Company's whitelisted IPs** section of the **Authkey** page.
- To allow only specific authkeys to work with n8n, add the n8n IP addresses in the **Whitelisted IPs** section of an authkey's details.
