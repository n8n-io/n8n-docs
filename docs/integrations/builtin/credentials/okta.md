# Okta credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Okta](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.okta.md)

## Prerequisites

Create an [Okta free trial](https://www.okta.com/free-trial/){:target=_blank .external-link} or create an admin account on an existing Okta org.

## Supported authentication methods

- SSWS API Access token

## Related resources

Refer to [Okta's documentation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using SSWS API access token

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- The **URL**: The base URL of your Okta org, also referred to as your unique subdomain. There are two quick ways to access it:
    1. In the Admin Console, select your **Profile**, hover over the domain listed below your username, and select the **Copy** icon. Paste this into n8n, but be sure to add `https://` before it.
    2. Copy the base URL of your Admin Console URL, for example `https://dev-123456-admin.okta.com`. Paste it into n8n and remove `-admin`, for example: `https://dev-123456.okta.com`.
- An **SSWS Access Token**: Create a token by going to **Security > API > Tokens > Create token**. Refer to [Create Okta API tokens](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/security/api.htm?cshid=ext-create-api-token#create-okta-api-token){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
