# Postgres credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Postgres](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/index.md)
- [Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index.md)
- [Postgres Chat Memory](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorypostgreschat.md) 
- [PGVector Vector Store](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstorepgvector.md) 

/// note | Agent node users
The Agent node doesn't support SSH tunnels.
///

## Prerequisites

[Create a user account](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createuser.html) on a Postgres server. 

## Supported authentication methods

- Database connection

## Related resources

Refer to [Postgres's documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/index.html){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using database connection

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- The **Host** or domain name for the server.
- The **Database** name.
- A **User** name.
- A user **Password**.
- **Ignore SSL Issues**: Set whether the credential connects if SSL validation fails.
- **SSL**: Choose whether to use SSL in your connection.
- The **Port** number to use for the connection.
- **SSH Tunnel**: Choose if you want to use SSH to encrypt the network connection with the Postgres server.

To set up the database connection:

1. Enter the **Host** or domain name for the Postgres server. You can either run the `/conninfo` command to confirm the host name or run this query:

    ```
    SELECT inet_server_addr();
    ```

2. Enter the **Database** name. Run the `/conninfo` command to confirm the database name.
3. Enter the **User** name of the user you wish to connect as.
4. Enter the user's **Password**.
5. **Ignore SSL Issues**: If you turn this on, the credential will connect even if SSL validation fails.
6. **SSL**: Choose whether to use SSL in your connection. Refer to Postgres [SSL Support](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/libpq-ssl.html){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information. Options include:
    - **Allow**: Sets the `ssl-mode` parameter to `allow`. First try a non-SSL connection; if that fails, try an SSL connection.
    - **Disable**: Sets the `ssl-mode` parameter to `disable`. Only try a non-SSL connection.
    - **Require**: Sets the `ssl-mode` parameter to `require`. Only try an SSL connection. If a root CA file is present, verify that a trusted certificate authority (CA) issued the server certificate.
7. Enter the **Port** number to use for the connection. You can either run the `/conninfo` command to confirm the host name or run this query:

    ```
    SELECT inet_server_port();
    ```

8. **SSH Tunnel**: Turn this setting on to connect to the database over SSH. Refer to [SSH tunnel limitations](#ssh-tunnel-limitations) for some guidance around using SSH. Once turned on, you'll need:
    1. Select **SSH Authenticate with** to set the SSH Tunnel type to build:
        - Select **Password** if you want to connect to SSH using a password.
        - Select **Private Key** if you want to connect to SSH using an identity file (private key) and a passphrase.
    2. Enter the remote bind address you're connecting to as the **SSH Host**.
    3. **SSH Port**: Enter the local port number for the SSH tunnel.
    4. **SSH Postgres Port**: Enter the remote end of the tunnel, the port number the database server is using.
    5. **SSH User**: Enter the username to log in as.
    6. If you selected **Password** for SSH Authenticate with, add the user's **SSH Password**.
    7. If you selected **Private Key** for **SSH Authenticate with**:
        1. Add the contents of the **Private Key** or identity file used for SSH.
        2. If the **Private Key** was created with a passphrase, enter that **Passphrase**. If the **Private Ke**y has no passphrase, leave this field blank.

Refer to [Secure TCP/IP Connections with SSH Tunnels](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/ssh-tunnels.html){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

### SSH tunnel limitations

Only use the **SSH Tunnel** setting if:

- You're using the credential with the [Postgres](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/index.md) node (Agent node doesn't support SSH tunnels).
- You have an SSH server running on the same machine as the Postgres server.
- You have a user account that can log in using `ssh`.
