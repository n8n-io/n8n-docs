## Related resources

Refer to [PostHog's API documentation](https://posthog.com/docs/api){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.


## Using API key

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- The API **URL**: Enter the correct domain for your API requests:
    - On US Cloud, use `https://us.i.posthog.com` for public POST-only endpoints or `https://us.posthog.com` for private endpoints.
    - On EU Cloud, use `https://eu.i.posthog.com` for public POST-only endpoints or `https://eu.posthog.com` for private endpoints.
    - For self-hosted instances, use your self-hosted domain. 
    - Confirm yours by checking your PostHog instance URL.
- An **API Key**: The API key you use depends on whether you're accessing public or private endpoints:
    - For public POST-only endpoints, use a [Project API key](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings) from your project's **General** Settings.
    - For private endpoints, use a [Personal API key](https://app.posthog.com/settings/user-api-keys) from your User account's **Personal API Keys** Settings. Refer to [How to obtain a personal API key](https://posthog.com/docs/api#private-endpoint-authentication){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
