# Pushbullet credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Pushbullet](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.pushbullet.md)

## Prerequisites

Create a [Pushbullet](https://www.pushbullet.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account.

## Supported authentication methods

- OAuth2

## Related resources

Refer to [Pushbullet's API documentation](https://docs.pushbullet.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using OAuth2

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**: Generated when you create a Pushbullet app, also known as an OAuth client.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated when you create a Pushbullet app, also known as an OAuth client.

To generate the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, go to the [create client](https://www.pushbullet.com/create-client) page. Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from n8n and add this as your **redirect_uri** for the app/client. Use the **client_id** and **client_secret** from the OAuth Client in your n8n credential.

Refer to Pushbullet's [OAuth2 Guide](https://docs.pushbullet.com/#oauth2) for more information.

/// note | Pushbullet OAuth test link
Pushbullet offers a test link during the client creation process described above. This link isn't compatible with n8n. To verify the authentication works, use the **Connect my account** button in n8n.
