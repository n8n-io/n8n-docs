# Reddit credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Reddit](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.reddit.md)

## Prerequisites

Create a [Reddit](https://reddit.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account.

## Supported authentication methods

- OAuth2

## Related resources

Refer to [Reddit's developer documentation](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/14945211791892-Developer-Platform-Accessing-Reddit-Data){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using OAuth2

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**
- A **Client Secret**

/// note | Developer program
Reddit's developer program is in a closed beta. The instructions below are for regular Reddit users, not members of the developer platform.
///

Generate both by creating a [third-party app](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps){:target=_blank .external-link}. Visit the previous link or go to your **profile > Settings > Safety & Privacy > Manage third-party app authorization > are you a developer? create an app**.

Use these settings for your app:

- Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from n8n and use it as your app's **redirect uri**.
- The app's client ID displays underneath your app name. Copy that and add it as your n8n **Client ID**.
- Copy the app's **secret** and add it as your n8n **Client Secret**.
