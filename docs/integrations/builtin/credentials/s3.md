# S3 credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [S3](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.s3.md)

## Prerequisites

Create an account on an S3-compatible server. Use the S3 node for generic or non-AWS S3 like:

* [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces){:target="_blank" .external-link}
* [MinIO](https://min.io/){:target="_blank" .external-link}
* [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/){:target="_blank" .external-link}

## Supported authentication methods

- S3 endpoint

## Related resources

Refer to your S3-compatible provider's documentation for more information on the services. For example, refer to [Wasabi's REST API documentation](https://docs.wasabi.com/docs/rest-api-introduction){:target="_blank" .external-link} or [DigitalOcean's Spaces API Reference Documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/spaces-api/){:target="_blank" .external-link}.

## Using S3 endpoint

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **S3 Endpoint**: Enter the URL endpoint for the S3 storage backend.
- A **Region**: Enter the region for your S3 storage. Some providers call this the "region slug."
- An **Access Key ID**: Enter the S3 access key your S3 provider uses to access the bucket or space. Some providers call this API keys.
- A **Secret Access Key**: Enter the secret access key for the **Access Key ID**.
- **Force Path Style**: When turned on, the connection uses path-style addressing for buckets.
- **Ignore SSL Issues**: When turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.

More detailed instructions for DigitalOcean Spaces and Wasabi follow. If you're using a different provider, refer to their documentation for more information. 

### Using DigitalOcean Spaces

To configure the credential for use with DigitalOcean spaces:

1. In DigitalOceans, go to the control panel and open **Settings**. Your endpoint should be listed there. Prepend `https://` to that endpoint and enter it as the **S3 Endpoint** in n8n.
    - Your DigitalOceans endpoint depends on the data center region your bucket's in.
2. For the **Region**, enter the region your bucket's located in, for example, `nyc3`.
    - If you plan to use this credential to create new Spaces, enter `us-east-1` instead.
3. From your DigitalOceans control panel, go to [**API**](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/spaces){:target="_blank" .external-link}.
4. Open the **Spaces Keys** tab.
5. Select **Generate New Key**.
6. Enter a **Name** for your key, like `n8n integration` and select the checkmark.
7. Copy the **Key** displayed next to the name and enter this as the **Access Key ID** in n8n.
8. Copy the **Secret** value and enter this as the **Secret Access Key** in n8n.
    - Refer to [Sharing Access to Buckets with Access Keys](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/how-to/manage-access/#access-keys){:target="_blank" .external-link} for more information on generating the key and secret.
9. Keep the **Force Path Style** toggle turned off unless you want to use subdomain/virtual calling format.
10. Decide how you want the n8n credential to handle SSL:
    - To respect SSL certificate validation, keep the default of **Ignore SSL Issues** turned off.
    - To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.

Refer to DigitalOcean's [Spaces API Reference Documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/spaces-api/){:target="_blank" .external-link} for more information.

### Using Wasabi

To configure the credential for use with Wasabi:

1. For the **S3 Endpoint**, enter the service URL for your bucket's region. Start it with `https://`.
    - Refer to [What are the service URLs for Wasabi's different storage regions?](https://knowledgebase.wasabi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015106031-What-are-the-service-URLs-for-Wasabi-s-different-storage-regions){:target="_blank" .external-link} to identify the correct URL.
2. For the **Region**, enter the region slug portion of the service URL. For example, if you entered `https://s3.us-east-2.wasabisys.com` as the **S3 Endpoint**, `us-east-2` is the region.
3. Log into you Wasabi Console as the root user.
4. Open the **Menu** and select **Access Keys**.
5. Select **CREATE NEW ACCESS KEY**.
6. Select whether the key is for the **Root User** or a **Sub-User** and select **CREATE**.
7. Copy the **Access Key** and enter it in n8n as the **Access Key ID**.
8. Copy the **Secret Key** and enter it in n8n as the **Secret Access Key**.
    - Refer to [Creating a Wasabi API Access Key Set](https://knowledgebase.wasabi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019677192-Creating-a-Wasabi-API-Access-Key-Set){:target="_blank" .external-link} for more information on generating the key and secret.
9. Wasabi recommends turning on the **Force Path Style** toggle "because the path-style offers the greatest flexibility in bucket names, avoiding domain name issues." Refer to the Wasabi [REST API Introduction](https://docs.wasabi.com/docs/rest-api-introduction){:target="_blank" .external-link} for more information.
10. Decide how you want the n8n credential to handle SSL:
    - To respect SSL certificate validation, keep the default of **Ignore SSL Issues** turned off.
    - To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.
