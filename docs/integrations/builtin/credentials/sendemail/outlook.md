## Set up the credential

To configure the Send Email credential to use an Outlook.com account:

4. Enter `smtp-mail.outlook.com` as the **Host**.
5. Enter `587` for the **Port**.
6. Turn on the **SSL/TLS** toggle.

Refer to Microsoft's [POP, IMAP, and SMTP settings for Outlook.com](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/pop-imap-and-smtp-settings-for-outlook-com-d088b986-291d-42b8-9564-9c414e2aa040){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information.
