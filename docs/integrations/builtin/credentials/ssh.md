# SSH credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [SSH](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.ssh.md)

## Prerequisites

- Create a remote server with SSH enabled.
- Create a user account that can `ssh` into the server using one of the following:
    - Their own [password](#using-password)
    - An SSH [private key](#using-private-key)

## Supported authentication methods

- [Password](#using-password): Use this method if you have a user account that can `ssh` into the server using their own password.
- [Private key](#using-private-key): Use this method if you have a user account that uses an SSH key for the server or service.

Secure Shell (SSH) protocol is a method for securely sending commands over a network. Refer to [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) for an example of SSH setup.


## Using password

Use this method if you have a user account that can `ssh` into the server using their own password.

To configure this credential, you'll need to:

1. Enter the IP address of the server you're connecting to as the **Host**.
2. Enter the **Port** to use for the connection. SSH uses port `22` by default.
3. Enter the **Username** for a user account with `ssh` access on the server.
4. Enter the **Password** for that user account.

## Using private key

Use this method if you have a user account that uses an SSH key for the server or service.

To configure this credential, you'll need to:

1. Enter the IP address of the server you're connecting to as the **Host**.
2. Enter the **Port** to use for the connection. SSH uses port `22` by default.
3. Enter the **Username** of the account that generated the private key.
4. Enter the entire contents of your SSH **Private Key**.
5. If you created a **Passphrase** for the **Private Key**, enter the passphrase.
    - If you didn't create a passphrase for the key, leave blank.
