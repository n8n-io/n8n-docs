## Using Content API key

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A Content **API Key**: Go to your Storyblok workspace's **Settings > Access Tokens** to get an API key. Choose an **Access Level** of either **Public** (`version=published`) or **Preview** (`version-published` and `version=draft`). Enter this access token as your **API Key**. Refer to [How to retrieve and generate access tokens](https://www.storyblok.com/faq/retrieve-and-generate-access-tokens) for more detailed instructions.

Refer to [Content v1 API Authentication](https://www.storyblok.com/docs/api/content-delivery/v1#topics/authentication) for more information about supported operations with each Access Level.

## Using Management API key

To configure this credential, you'll need:
