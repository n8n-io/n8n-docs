# Strapi credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Strapi](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.strapi.md)

## Prerequisites

Create a [Strapi](https://strapi.io/){:target=_blank .external-link} admin account with:

- Access to an existing Strapi project.
- At least one collection type within that project.
- Published data within that collection type.

Refer to the Strapi developer [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/quick-start){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

## Supported authentication methods

- API user account: Requires a user account with appropriate content permissions.
- API token: Requires an admin account.

## Related resources

Refer to [Strapi's documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/api/rest){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API user account

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A user **Email**: Must be for a user account, not an admin account. Refer to the more detailed instructions below.
- A user **Password**: Must be for a user account, not an admin account. Refer to the more detailed instructions below.
- The **URL**: Use the public URL of your Strapi server, defined in `./config/server.js` as the `url` parameter. Strapi recommends using an absolute URL.
    - For Strapi Cloud projects, use the URL of your Cloud project, for example: `https://my-strapi-project-name.strapiapp.com`
- The **API Version**: Select the version of the API you want your calls to use. Options include:
    - **Version 3**
    - **Version 4**

In Strapi, the configuration involves two steps:

1. [Configure a role](#configure-a-role).
2. [Create a user account](#create-a-user-account).

Refer to the more detailed instructions below for each step.

### Configure a role

For API access, use the Users & Permissions Plugin in **Settings > Users & Permissions Plugin**.

Refer to [Configuring Users & Permissions Plugin](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/settings/configuring-users-permissions-plugin-settings){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on the plugin. Refer to [Configuring end-user roles](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-end-users-roles){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on roles.

For the n8n credential, the user must have a role that grants them API permissions on the collection type. For the role, you can either:

* Update the default **Authenticated** role to include the permissions and assign the user to that role. Refer to [Configuring role's permissions](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-end-users-roles#configuring-roles-permissions){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
* Create a new role to include the permissions and assign the user to that role. Refer to [Creating a new role](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-end-users-roles#creating-a-new-role){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

For either option, once you open the role:

1. Go to the **Permissions** section.
2. Open the section for the relevant collection type.
3. Select the permissions for the collection type that the role should have. Options include:
    - `create` (POST)
    - `find` and `findone` (GET)
    - `update` (PUT)
    - `delete` (DELETE)
4. Repeat for all relevant collection types.
5. Save the role.

Refer to [Endpoints](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/api/rest#endpoints){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on the permission options.

### Create a user account

Now that you have an appropriate role, create an end-user account and assign the role to it:

1. Go to **Content Manager > Collection Types > User**.
2. Select **Add new entry**.
3. Fill in the user details. The n8n credential requires these fields, though your Strapi project may have more custom required fields:
    - **Username**: Required for all Strapi users.
    - **Email**: Enter in Strapi and use as the **Email** in the n8n credential.
    - **Password**: Enter in Strapi and use as the **Password** in the n8n credential.
    - **Role**: Select the role you set up in the previous step.

Refer to [Managing end-user accounts](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/managing-end-users){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.


## Using API token

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **API Token**: Create an API token from **Settings > Global Settings > API Tokens**. Refer to Strapi's [Creating a new API token documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/settings/API-tokens#creating-a-new-api-token){:target=_blank .external-link} for more details and information on regenerating API tokens.
    
    /// note | API tokens permission
    If you don't see the **API tokens** option in **Global settings**, your account doesn't have the **API tokens > Read** permission.
    ///
    
- The **URL**: Use the public URL of your Strapi server, defined in `./config/server.js` as the `url` parameter. Strapi recommends using an absolute URL.
    - For Strapi Cloud projects, use the URL of your Cloud project, for example: `https://my-strapi-project-name.strapiapp.com`
- The **API Version**: Select the version of the API you want your calls to use. Options include:
    - **Version 3**
    - **Version 4**
