# Stripe credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Stripe Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stripetrigger.md)
- [Stripe](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stripe.md)

## Supported authentication methods

- API key

## Related resources

Refer to [Stripe's API documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/api){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API key

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Stripe](https://stripe.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} admin or developer account and:

- An API **Secret Key**

Before you generate an API key, decide whether to generate it in live mode or test mode. Refer to [Test mode and live mode](#test-mode-and-live-mode) for more information about the two modes.

### Live mode Secret key

To generate a Secret key in live mode:

1. Open the [Stripe developer dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/developers){:target=_blank .external-link} and select [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. In the **Standard Keys** section, select **Create secret key**.
3. Enter a **Key name**, like `n8n integration`.
4. Select **Create**. The new API key displays.
4. Copy the key and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Secret Key**.

Refer to Stripe's [Create a secret API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#create-api-secret-key){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

### Test mode Secret key

To use a Secret key in test mode, you must copy the existing one:

1. Go to your [Stripe test mode developer dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/developers){:target=_blank .external-link} and select [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. In the **Standard Keys** section, select **Reveal test key** for the **Secret key**.
3. Copy the key and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Secret Key**.

Refer to Stripe's [Create a secret API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#create-api-secret-key){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

## Test mode and live mode

All Stripe API requests happen within either [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode) or live mode. Each mode has its own API key. 

Use test mode to access simulated test data and live mode to access actual account data. Objects in one mode arenâ€™t accessible to the other.

Refer to [API keys | Test mode versus live mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about what's available in each mode and guidance on when to use each.

/// note | n8n credentials for both modes
If you want to work with both live mode and test mode keys, store each mode's key in a separate n8n credential.
///

## Key prefixes

Stripes' Secret keys always begin with `sk_`:

- Live keys begin with `sk_live_`.
- Test keys begin with `sk_test_`.

n8n hasn't tested these credentials with Restricted keys (prefixed `rk_`).

/// warning | Publishable keys
Don't use the Publishable keys (prefixed `pk_`) with your n8n credential.
///
