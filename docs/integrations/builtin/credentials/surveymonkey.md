# SurveyMonkey credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [SurveyMonkey Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.surveymonkeytrigger.md)


## Prerequisites

- Create a [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com){:target=_blank .external-link} account.
- [Register an app](https://api.surveymonkey.com/v3/docs?api_key=3yr7n6m8sjwvm48x8nhxej52#registering-an-app){:target=_blank .external-link} from your [**Developer dashboard > My apps**](https://developer.surveymonkey.com/apps/){:target=_blank .external-link}.
    - Refer to [Required app scopes](#required-app-scopes) for information on the scopes you must use.

## Supported authentication methods

- API access token
- OAuth2

## Related resources

Refer to [SurveyMonkey's API documentation](https://developer.surveymonkey.com/api/v3/#SurveyMonkey-Api){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API access token

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **Access Token**: Generated once you create an app.
- A **Client ID**: Generated once you create an app.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated once you create an app.

Once you've created your app and assigned appropriate scopes, go to **Settings > Credentials**. Copy the **Access Token**, **Client ID**, and **Secret** and add them to n8n.

## Using OAuth

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**: Generated once you create an app.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated once you create an app.

Once you've created your app and assigned appropriate scopes:

1. Go to the app's **Settings > Settings**.
2. From n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**.
3. Overwrite the app's existing **OAuth Redirect URL** with that URL.
4. Select **Submit Changes**.
5. Be sure the **Scopes** section contains the [Required app scopes](#required-app-scopes).

From the app's **Settings > Credentials**, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and add them to your n8n credential. You can now select **Connect my account** from n8n.

/// note | SurveyMonkey Test OAuth Flow
This option only works if you keep the default SurveyMonkey **OAuth Redirect URL** and add the n8n OAuth Redirect URL as an **Additional Redirect URL**.
///

## Required app scopes

Once you create your app, go to **Settings > Scopes**. Select these scopes for your n8n credential to work:

- **View Surveys**
- **View Collectors**
- **View Responses**
- **View Response Details**
- **Create/Modify Webhooks**
- **View Webhooks**

Select **Update Scopes** to save them.
