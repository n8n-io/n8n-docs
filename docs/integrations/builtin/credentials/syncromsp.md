## Related resources

Refer to [SyncroMSP's API documentation](https://api-docs.syncromsp.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API key

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **API Key**: Called an **API token** in SyncroMSP. To create an API token, go to your **user menu > Profile/Password > API Tokens** and select the option to **Create New Token**. Select **Custom Permissions** to enter a name for your token and adjust the permissions to match your requirements.
- Your **Subdomain**: Enter your SyncroMSP subdomain. This is visible in the URL of your SyncroMSP, located between `https://` and `.syncromsp.com`. If your full URL is `https://n8n-instance.syncromsp.com`, you'd enter `n8n-instance` as the subdomain.

Refer to [API Tokens](https://community.syncromsp.com/t/api-tokens/2297){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on creating new tokens.
