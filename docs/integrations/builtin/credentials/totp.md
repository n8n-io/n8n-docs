# TOTP credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [TOTP](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.totp.md)

## Prerequisites

Generate a TOTP **Secret** and **Label**.

## Supported authentication methods

- Secret and label

## Related resources

Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) is an algorithm that generates a one-time password (OTP) using the current time. Refer to [Google Authenticator | Key URI format](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

## Using secret and label

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Secret**: The secret key encoded in the QR code during authenticator setup. It's an arbitrary key value encoded in Base32, for example: `BVDRSBXQB2ZEL5HE`. Refer to [Google Authenticator Secret](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format#secret){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
- A **Label**: The identifier for the account. It contains an account name as a URI-encoded string. You can include prefixes to identify the provider or service managing the account. If you use prefixes, use a literal or url-encoded colon to separate the issuer prefix and the account name, for example: `GitHub:john-doe`. Refer to [Google Authenticator Label](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format#label){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
