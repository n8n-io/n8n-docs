# TOTP credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes with ActiveCampaign.

- [TOTP](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.totp/)

To use TOTP, you need a **Secret**, which is the secret key encoded in the QR code during authenticator setup, and a **Label**, which is the identifier for the account. 

Refer to [Google Authenticator | Key URI format](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
