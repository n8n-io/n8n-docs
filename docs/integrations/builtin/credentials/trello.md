- [Trello Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.trellotrigger.md)

## Supported authentication methods

- API key

## Related resources

Refer to [Trello's API documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/api-introduction/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API key

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Trello](https://trello.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account and:

- An **API Key**
- An **API Token**

To generate both the API Key and API Token, create a Trello Power-Up:

1. Open the Trello [Power-Up Admin Portal](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. Select **New**.
3. Enter a **Name** for your Power-Up, like `n8n integration`.
4. Select the **Workspace** the Power-Up should have access to.
5. Leave the **iframe connector URL** blank.
6. Enter appropriate contact information.
7. Select **Create**.
8. This should open the Power-Up to the **API Key** page. (If it doesn't, open that page.)
9. Select **Generate a new API Key**.
10. Copy the **API key** from Trello and enter it in your n8n credential.
11. In your Trello API key page, enter your n8n base URL as an **Allowed origin**.
12. In **Capabilities** make sure to select the necessary options.
13. Select the **Token** link next to your Trello **API Key**.
14. When prompted, select **Allow** to grant all the permissions asked for.
15. Copy the Trello **Token** and enter it as the n8n **API Token**.
