## Using Cloud API key

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Workspace Key**: Generated when you install the **n8n** application to your Twake Cloud environment and select **Configure**.

- A **Public ID**: Generated when you create an app.
- A **Private API Key**: Generated when you create an app.

To generate your **Public ID** and **Private API Key**, [create a Twake application](https://doc.twake.app/developers-api/get-started/create-your-first-application){:target=_blank .external-link}: 

1. Go to **Workspace Settings > Applications and connectors > Access your applications and connectors > Create an application**.
2. Enter appropriate details.
