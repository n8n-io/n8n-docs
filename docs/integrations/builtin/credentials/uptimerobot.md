## Using API key

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **API Key**: Get your API Key from **My Settings > API Settings**. Create a **Main API Key** and enter this key in your n8n credential.

### API key types

UptimeRobot supports three API key types:

- **Monitor-specific**: Pulls data for a single monitor.
- **Read-only**: Only runs `GET` API calls.

To complete all of the operations in the UptimeRobot node, use the **Main** or **Account-specific** API key type. Refer to [API authentication](https://uptimerobot.com/api/#auth){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
