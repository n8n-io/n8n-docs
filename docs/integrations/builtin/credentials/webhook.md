## Using JWT auth

[**JWT Auth**](https://jwt.io/introduction/){:target=_blank .external-link} is a method of authentication that uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to digitally sign data. This authentication method uses the **JWT credential** and can use either a **Passphrase** or **PEM Key** as key type. Refer to [JWT credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/jwt.md) for more information.
