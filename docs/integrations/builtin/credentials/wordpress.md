# WordPress credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [WordPress](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wordpress.md)

## Prerequisites

- Create a [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account or deploy WordPress on a server.

## Supported authentication methods

- Basic auth

## Related resources

Refer to [WordPress's API documentation](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using basic auth

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- Your WordPress **Username**
- A WordPress application **Password**
- Your **WordPress URL**
- Decide whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**

Using this credential involves three steps:

1. [Enable two-step authentication](#enable-two-step-authentication).
2. [Create an application password](#create-an-application-password).
3. [Set up the credential](#set-up-the-credential).

Refer to the detailed instructions below for each step.

### Enable two-step authentication

To generate an application password, you must first enable Two-Step Authentication in WordPress. If you've already done this, [skip to the next section](#create-an-application-password).

1. Open your WordPress [profile](https://wordpress.com/me){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. Select **Security** from the left menu.
3. Select **Two-Step Authentication**. The **Two-Step Authentication** page opens.
4. If Two-Step Authentication isn't enabled, you must enable it.
5. Choose whether to enable it using an authenticator app or SMS codes and follow the on-screen instructions.

Refer to WordPress's [Enable Two-Step Authentication](https://wordpress.com/support/security/two-step-authentication/){:target=_blank .external-link} for detailed instructions.

### Create an application password

With Two-Step Authentication enabled, you can now generate an application password:

1. From the WordPress **Security >** [**Two-Step Authentication**](https://wordpress.com/me/security/two-step) page, select **+ Add new application password** in the **Application passwords** section.
5. Enter an **Application name**, like `n8n integration`.
6. Select **Generate Password**.
7. Copy the password it generates. You'll use this in your n8n credential.

### Set up the credential

Congratulations! You're now ready to set up your n8n credential:

1. Enter your WordPress **Username** in your n8n credential.
2. Enter the application password you copied above as the **Password** in your n8n credential.
3. Enter the URL of your WordPress site as the **WordPress URL**.
4. Optional: Use the **Ignore SSL Issues** to choose whether you want the n8n credential to connect even if SSL certificate validation fails (turned on) or whether to respect SSL certificate validation (turned off).
