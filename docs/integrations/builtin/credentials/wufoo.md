# Wufoo credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Wufoo Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wufootrigger/)

## Prerequisites

Create a [Wufoo](https://wufoo.com){:target=_blank .external-link} account.

## Supported authentication methods

- API key

## Related resources

Refer to [Wufoo's API documentation](https://wufoo.github.io/docs/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API key

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **API Key**: Get your API key from the [Wufoo Form Manager](https://app.wufoo.com/#/form-manager){:target=_blank .external-link}. To the right of a form, select **More > API Information**. Refer to [Using API Information and Webhooks](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/wufoo/integrations/wufoo-api/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
- A **Subdomain**: Your subdomain is the part of your Wufoo URL that comes after `https://` and before `wufoo.com`. So if the full domain is `https://n8n.wufoo.com`, the subdomain is `n8n`. Admins can view the subdomain in the [**Account Manager**](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/wufoo/account-manager){:target=_blank .external-link}. Refer to [Your Subdomain](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/wufoo/account/your-subdomain/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
