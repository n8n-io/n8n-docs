# Zoom credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Zoom](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.zoom.md)

## Prerequisites

Create a [Zoom](https://zoom.us/){:target=_blank .external-link} account. Your account must have one of the following permissions:

- Account owner
- Account admin
- Zoom for developers role

## Supported authentication methods

- API JWT token
- OAuth2

/// warning | API JWT token deprecation
Zoom removed support for JWT access tokens in June 2023. You must use OAuth2 for all new credentials.

Refer to [Zoom's API documentation](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API JWT token

This authentication method has been fully deprecated by Zoom. Don't create new credentials with it.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **JWT token**: To create a JWT token, create a new JWT app in the [Zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Using OAuth2

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**: Generated when you create an OAuth app on the Zoom App Marketplace.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated when you create an OAuth app.

To generate your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, [create an OAuth app](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/create/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

Use these settings for your OAuth app:

- Select **User-managed app** for **Select how the app is managed**.
- Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from n8n and enter it as an **OAuth Redirect URL** in Zoom.
- If your n8n credential displays a **Whitelist URL**, also enter that URL as a an **OAuth Redirect URL**.
- Enter **Scopes** for the scopes you plan to use. For all functionality in the [Zoom](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.zoom.md) node, select:
    - `meeting:read`
    - `meeting:write`
    - Refer to [OAuth scopes | Meeting scopes](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/oauth-scopes/#meeting-scopes){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on meeting scopes.
- Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** provided in the Zoom app and enter them in your n8n credential.
