## Find your Box Target ID

1. Open the file/folder that you would like to monitor.
2. Copy the string of characters after `folder/` in your URL. This is the target ID. For example, if the URL is `https://app.box.com/folder/12345`, then `12345` is the target ID.
3. Paste it in the **Target ID** field in n8n.
