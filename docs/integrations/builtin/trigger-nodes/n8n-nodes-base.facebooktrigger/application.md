## Trigger configuration

To configure the trigger with this Object:

1. Select the **Credential to connect with**. Select an existing or create a new [Facebook App credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookapp.md).
1. Enter the **APP ID** of the app connected to your credential. Refer to the [Facebook App credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookapp.md) documentation for more information.
1. Select **Application** as the **Object**.
1. **Field Names or IDs**: By default, the node will trigger on all the available events using the `*` wildcard filter. If you'd like to limit the events, use the `X` to remove the star and use the dropdown or an expression to select the updates you're interested in. Options include:
    * **Add Account**
    * **Ads Rules Engine**
    * **Async Requests**
    * **Async Sessions**    
    * **Group Install**
    * **Oe Reseller Onboarding Request Created**
    * **Plugin Comment**
    * **Plugin Comment Reply**
1. In **Options**, turn on the toggle to **Include Values**. This Object type fails without the option enabled.
