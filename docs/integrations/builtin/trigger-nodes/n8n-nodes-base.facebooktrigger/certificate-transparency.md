## Trigger configuration

To configure the trigger with this Object:

1. Select the **Credential to connect with**. Select an existing or create a new [Facebook App credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookapp.md).
1. Enter the **APP ID** of the app connected to your credential. Refer to the [Facebook App credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookapp.md) documentation for more information.
1. Select **Certificate Transparency** as the **Object**.
1. **Field Names or IDs**: By default, the node will trigger on all the available events using the `*` wildcard filter. If you'd like to limit the events, use the `X` to remove the star and use the dropdown or an expression to select the updates you're interested in. Options include:
    * **Certificate**: Notifies you when someone issues a new certificate for your subscribed domains. You'll need to subscribe your domain for certificate alerts.
    * **Phishing**: Notifies you when someone issues a new certificate that may be phishing one of your legitimate subscribed domains.
1. In **Options**, turn on the toggle to **Include Values**. This Object type fails without the option enabled.

For these alerts, you'll need to subscribe your domain to the relevant alerts:

* Refer to [Certificate Alerts](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/certificate-transparency-api#certificate-alerts-subscribing){:target=_blank .external-link} for Certificate Alerts subscriptions.
* Refer to [Phishing Alerts](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/certificate-transparency-api#phishing-alerts-subscribing){:target=_blank .external-link} for Phishing Alerts subscriptions.
