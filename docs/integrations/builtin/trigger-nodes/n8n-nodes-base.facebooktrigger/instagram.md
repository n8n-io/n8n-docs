## Trigger configuration

To configure the trigger with this Object:

1. Select the **Credential to connect with**. Select an existing or create a new [Facebook App credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookapp.md).
1. Enter the **APP ID** of the app connected to your credential. Refer to the [Facebook App credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookapp.md) documentation for more information.
1. Select **Instagram** as the **Object**.
1. **Field Names or IDs**: By default, the node will trigger on all the available events using the `*` wildcard filter. If you'd like to limit the events, use the `X` to remove the star and use the dropdown or an expression to select the updates you're interested in. Options include:
    * **Comments**: Notifies you when anyone comments on an IG Media owned by your app's Instagram user.
    * **Messaging Handover**
    * **Mentions**: Notifies you whenever an Instagram user @mentions an Instagram Business or Creator Account in a comment or caption.
    * **Messages**: Notifies you when anyone messages your app's Instagram user.
    * **Messaging Seen**: Notifies you when someone sees a message sent by your app's Instagram user.
    * **Standby**
    * **Story Insights**: Notifies you one hour after a story expires with metrics describing interactions on a story.
1. In **Options**, turn on the toggle to **Include Values**. This Object type fails without the option enabled.
