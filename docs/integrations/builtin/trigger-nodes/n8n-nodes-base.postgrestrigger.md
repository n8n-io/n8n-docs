# Postgres Trigger node

Use the Postgres Trigger node to respond to events in [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/){:target=_blank .external-link} and integrate Postgres with other applications. n8n has built-in support responding to insert, update, and delete events.

## Events

You can configure how the node listens for events.

* Select **Listen and Create Trigger Rule**, then choose the events to listen for:
	* Insert
	* Update
	* Delete
* Select **Listen to Channel**, then enter a channel name that the node should monitor.
