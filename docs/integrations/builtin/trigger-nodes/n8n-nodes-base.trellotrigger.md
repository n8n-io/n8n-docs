# Trello Trigger node

[Trello](https://trello.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} is a web-based Kanban-style list-making application which is a subsidiary of Atlassian. Users can create their task boards with different columns and move the tasks between them.

## Find the Model ID

The model ID is the ID of any model in Trello. Depending on the use-case, it could be the User ID, List ID, and so on.

For this specific example, the List ID would be the Model ID:

1. Open the Trello board that contains the list.
2. If the list doesn't have any cards, add a card to the list.
3. Open the card, add `.json` at the end of the URL, and press enter.
4. In the JSON file, you will see a field called `idList`.
5. Copy `idList`and paste it in the **Model ID** field in n8n.
