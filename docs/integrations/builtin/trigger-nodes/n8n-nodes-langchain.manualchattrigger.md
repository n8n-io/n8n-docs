# Manual Chat Trigger

The Manual Chat Trigger node allows you to test LangChain workflows that require a user conversation as input.

On this page, you'll find information on how to use the Manual Chat Trigger, and links to more resources.


!!! note "Examples and templates"
	For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [LangChain integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/manual-chat-trigger/){:target=_blank .external-link} page.

## Usage

Use this node to start a workflow with a chat session. This node is part of the LangChain feature. You can use it with the [Conversational Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/).

After adding the Manual Chat Trigger to your workflow, n8n displays the **Chat** button. Use this instead of **Execute Workflow** to test your workflow.
