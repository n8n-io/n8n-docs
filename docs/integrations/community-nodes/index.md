# Overview

The Community Nodes repository allows n8n users to publish and install custom nodes. 

n8n provides hundreds of built-in nodes. It also supports users [creating their own nodes](/integrations/creating-nodes/){:target=_blank}. The Community Nodes repository allows users who create nodes to publish them to npm. These nodes are then available to install and use in your n8n instance.
