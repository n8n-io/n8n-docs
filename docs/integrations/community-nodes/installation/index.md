# Install and manage community nodes

There are two ways to install community nodes:

* Within n8n [using the GUI](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/gui-install/).
* [Manually from the command line](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/manual-install/): use this method if your n8n instance doesn't support installation through the in-app GUI.

/// note | Only available on self-hosted instances
Community nodes aren't available on n8n cloud and require [self-hosting](/hosting/) n8n.
