# Install and manage community nodes

There are three ways to install community nodes:

* Within n8n using the [nodes panel](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/verified-install.md) (for verified community nodes only).
* Within n8n [using the GUI](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/gui-install.md): Use this method to install community nodes from the npm registry.
* [Manually from the command line](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/manual-install.md): use this method to install community nodes from npm if your n8n instance doesn't support installation through the in-app GUI.

/// note | Installing from npm only available on self-hosted instances
Unverified community nodes aren't available on n8n cloud and require [self-hosting](/hosting/index.md) n8n.
