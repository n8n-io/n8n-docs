## Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently from standard nodes when processing multiple input items using expressions.

Most nodes process all input items independently. For example, if you use the expression `{{ $json.name }}` with five inputs, it resolves each name individually.

However, sub-nodes always resolve expressions using the **first input item**. In the same example, `{{ $json.name }}` would return the first name for all five items.

## Node Parameters

- **Model**: Select the Straico model to use for generating completions. Available models are dynamically fetched via the Straico API. Refer to the [Straico Model Reference](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5900072/2s9YyzddrR#7527bcfd-0c71-4ee9-b67f-3ce21b41e5f2) for more information.

## Node Options

- **Frequency Penalty**: Reduces the likelihood of repeated phrases. Higher values increase penalty for repetition.
- **Maximum Number of Tokens**: Sets the length of the response. Straico models support up to 32,000 tokens.
- **Response Format**: Choose between `text` or `JSON`. Select `JSON` for structured responses.
- **Presence Penalty**: Encourages the model to talk about new topics by adjusting topic diversity.
- **Sampling Temperature**: Controls creativity. Lower values are more deterministic; higher values are more diverse (but may hallucinate).
- **Top P**: Sets nucleus sampling probability. Lower values reduce randomness.
- **Timeout**: Set a time limit for each API request (in milliseconds).
- **Max Retries**: Number of retry attempts in case of a failed request.
