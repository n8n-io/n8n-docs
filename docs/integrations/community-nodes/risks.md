# Risks when using community nodes

Installing community nodes from npm means you are installing unverified code from a public source into your n8n instance. This has some risks.

Risks include:

* System security: community nodes have full access to the machine that n8n runs on, and can do anything, including malicious actions.
* Data security: any community node that you use has access to data in your workflows.
* Breaking changes: node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes.

/// note | n8n vets verified community nodes
In addition to publicly available community nodes from npm, n8n inspects some nodes and makes them available as [verified community node inside the nodes panel](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/verified-install.md). These nodes have to meet a set of data and system security requirements for approval.

## Report bad community nodes

<!-- vale off -->

You can report bad community nodes to [security@n8n.io](mailto: security@n8n.io)

<!-- vale on -->

## Disable community nodes

If you are self-hosting n8n, you can disable community nodes by setting `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ENABLED` to `false`. On n8n cloud, visit the [Cloud Admin Panel](https://docs.n8n.io/manage-cloud/cloud-admin-dashboard/) and disable community nodes from there. See [troubleshooting](/integrations/community-nodes/troubleshooting.md) for more information.
