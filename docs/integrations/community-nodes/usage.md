# Using community nodes

To use community nodes, you first need to [install](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/index.md) them.

## Adding community nodes to your workflow

After installing a community node, you can use it like any other node. n8n displays the node in search results in the **Nodes** panel. n8n marks community nodes with a **Package** <span class="n8n-inline-image">![Package icon](/_images/common-icons/package.png){.off-glb}</span> icon in the nodes panel.

## Community nodes with duplicate names

It's possible for several community nodes to have the same name. If you use two nodes with the same name in your workflow, they'll look the same, unless they have different icons.
