This section provides tutorials on building nodes. It covers:

* [Tutorial: Build a declarative-style node](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node.md)
* [Reference](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/index.md) material on [file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure.md), parameter definitions for [base](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/index.md), [codex](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-codex-files.md), and [credentials](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/credentials-files.md) files, [node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements.md), and more.

Coming soon:

* More tutorials
* Revised guidance on standards

<!--
* [Build a programmatic-style node](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/programmatic-style-node.md)
* [Build a trigger node](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/create-trigger-node/)


If you are unsure which tutorial to use, refer to [Choose your node building approach](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method.md) to understand the different styles of node building.
