# Overview

This section provides information on building nodes. It includes:

Three tutorials:

* [Build a declarative-style node](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/)
* [Build a programmatic-style node](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/programmatic-style-node/)
* [Build a trigger node](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/create-trigger-node/)

If you are unsure which tutorial to use, refer to [Plan - Choose your node building approach](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/) to understand the different styles of node building.
