# Overview

When building a node, there are design choices you need to make before you start:

* Which [node building style](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/) to use.
* Your [UI design and UX principles](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/node-ui-design/)
* Your node's [file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure/).
