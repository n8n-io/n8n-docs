# Plan a node

This section provides guidance on designing your node, including key technical decisions such as choosing your node building style.

When building a node, there are design choices you need to make before you start:

* Which [node type](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/node-types.md) you need to build.
* Which [node building style](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method.md) to use.
* Your [UI design and UX principles](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/node-ui-design.md)
* Your node's [file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure.md).
