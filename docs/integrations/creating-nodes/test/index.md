# Test a node

This section contains information about testing your node.

There are two ways to test your node:

* Manually, by [running it on your own machine](/integrations/creating-nodes/test/run-node-locally.md) within a local n8n instance.
* Automatically, using the [linter](/integrations/creating-nodes/test/node-linter.md).

You should use both methods before publishing your node.
