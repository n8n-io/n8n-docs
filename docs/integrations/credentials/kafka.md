# Kafka

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes with Kafka.

- [Kafka](/integrations/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.kafka/)
- [Kafka Trigger](/integrations/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.kafkaTrigger/)

## Prerequisites

Have Kafka up and running. You can refer to the official [documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart) to learn how to do that.

## Using Kafka

1. Enter a client ID in the ***Client ID*** field.
2. Retrieve the Kafka Brokers and credentials (if any).
3. Use the ***Client ID***, ***Brokers*** (comma separated), ***Username***, and ***Password*** with your Kafka node credentials in n8n.
