Explore this collection of resources to start automating with n8n. Treat it as a map to navigate through our knowledge base and community.

## Set up your n8n

- Sign up for a [free trial on n8n Cloud](https://app.n8n.cloud/register), or install the community edition with [Docker](/hosting/installation/docker.md) (recommended) or [npm](/hosting/installation/npm.md)
- Check out other [installation options](/choose-n8n.md) to meet your needs

## Automate right away

Try n8n out with these first-time user guides:

- [Quickstart](/try-it-out/quickstart.md) in 3 steps
- Build an [n8n workflow](/try-it-out/tutorial-first-workflow.md) from scratch
- Develop an [AI chat agent](/advanced-ai/intro-tutorial.md)

## Join a mingling community

Journey through all things automation with fellow n8n builders and enthusiasts:

- [ask questions](https://community.n8n.io/t/readme-welcome-to-the-n8n-community/44381) and [make feature requests](https://community.n8n.io/c/feature-requests) in the community forum
- [report bugs](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues) and [contribute](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) on GitHub

## Manage the learning path

We've developed video and text-based courses to aid your n8n adoption and simplify the learning curve.

### Video courses

Learn key concepts and n8n features while building examples as you go.

- The [Beginner](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlET0GsrLUL59YbxstZE71WszP3pVnZfI) course covers the basics of n8n.
- The [Advanced](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlET0GsrLUL5bxmx5c1H1Ms_OtOPYZIEG) course dives into more sophisticated workflows, details technical nodes, and introduces enterprise features.

### Text courses

[Level 1: Beginner course](https://blog.n8n.io/announcing-the-n8n-certification-course-for-beginners-level-1/) walks through the Editor UI, showcases data structures in n8n, and explains node/workflow configuration. **Achievements** upon completion include a 2-node workflow that retrieves articles from Hacker News and a 7-node workflow that pulls and analyzes records from a data warehouse.

[Level 2: Intermediate course](https://blog.n8n.io/announcing-course-level-two/) focuses on understanding data structures in n8n and handling a range of data-driven use cases. **Achievements** upon completion include the ability to process different data types, merge data from different sources, and manage error workflows.

## Self-host n8n

- Choose your fighter among n8nâ€™s various [self-hosting offerings](/hosting/index.md)
- If in doubt, consider popular [DigitalOcean](/hosting/installation/server-setups/digital-ocean.md) or [AWS](/hosting/installation/server-setups/aws.md) options

## Build a node

If you can't find a node for a specific app or service, build one yourself and share it with the community.

- Follow a 7-step tutorial to develop a [declarative-style node](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node.md)
- Watch a YouTube webinar to build [custom n8n nodes](https://www.youtube.com/live/OI6zHJ56eW0?si=SMD7L1J5fZ2mf79W)
- Explore a collection of [independent node contributions](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:n8n-community-node-package)

## Stay tuned

- Discover new features and bug fixes in the [release notes](/release-notes.md)
- Follow n8n on socials: [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vWwMVThRta), [X (former Twitter)](https://twitter.com/n8n_io), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@n8n-io), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/n8n/)
