# License Key

To enable certain licensed features, you must first activate your license. You can do this either through the UI or by setting environment variables.

## Add a license key using the UI

In your n8n instance:

1. Log in as **Admin** or **Owner**.
1. Select **Settings** > **Usage and plan**.
1. Select **Enter activation key**.
1. Paste in your license key.
1. Select **Activate**.

## Add a license key using an environment variables

In your n8n configuration, set `N8N_LICENSE_ACTIVATION_KEY` to your license key. If the instance already has an activated license, this variable will have no effect.

Refer to [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods.md) to learn more about configuring n8n.

## Allowlist the license server IP addresses

n8n uses Cloudflare to host the license server. As the specific IP addresses can change, you need to allowlist the [full range of Cloudflare IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/) to ensure n8n can always reach the license server.
