# Log streaming

/// info | Feature availability
Log streaming is available on Enterprise Self-hosted and Cloud plans.
///

Log streaming allows you to send events from n8n to your own logging tools. This allows you to manage your n8n monitoring in your own alerting and logging processes.

## Set up log streaming

To use log streaming, you have to add a streaming destination.

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Log Streaming**.
2. Select **Add new destination**.
3. Choose your destination type. n8n opens the **New Event Destination** modal.
4. In the **New Event Destination** modal, enter the configuration information for your event destination. These depend on the type of destination you're using.
5. Select **Events** to choose which events to stream.
6. Select **Save**.

/// note | Self-hosted users
If you self-host n8n, you can configure additional log streaming behavior using [Environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/logs.md#log-streaming).
