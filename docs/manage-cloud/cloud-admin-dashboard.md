# Cloud admin dashboard

Instance owners can access the admin dashboard to manage their Cloud instance. This is where you can upgrade your n8n version and set the timezone.

## Access the dashboard from the app

1. [Log in to n8n](https://app.n8n.cloud/magic-link)
1. Select **Admin Dashboard**. n8n opens the dashboard.

## Access the dashboard if the app is offline

If your instance is down, you can still access the admin dashboard. When you log in to the app, n8n will ask you if you want a magic link to access your dashboard. Select **Send magic link**, then check your email for the link.
