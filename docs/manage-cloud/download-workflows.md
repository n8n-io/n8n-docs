# Download workflows

n8n Cloud instance owners can download workflows from the most recent backup.

You can do this with the [Cloud admin dashboard](/manage-cloud/cloud-admin-dashboard.md).

## How to download workflows

1. [Log in to n8n](https://app.n8n.cloud/magic-link).
1. Select **Admin Dashboard** to open the dashboard.
1. In the **Manage** section, select the **Export** tab.
1. Select **Download Workflows**.

## Accessing workflows after your free trial

You have **90 days** to download your workflows after your free trial ends. After that, all workflows will be **permanently deleted** and are unrecoverable.
