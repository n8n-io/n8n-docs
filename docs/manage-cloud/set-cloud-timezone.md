# Set the Cloud instance timezone

You can change the timezone for your n8n instance. This affects the [Schedule Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/index.md) and [Date & Time node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime.md). Users can configure the timezone for individual workflows in [Workflow settings](/workflows/settings.md).

1. On your dashboard, select **Manage**.
1. Change the **Timezone** dropdown to the timezone you want.
