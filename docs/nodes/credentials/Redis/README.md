# Redis

You can find information about the operations supported by the Redis node on the [integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/n8n-nodes-base.redis) page. You can also browse the source code of the node on [GitHub](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Redis).

## Prerequisites

Create an user account on a Redis server. 

## Using Database Connection

1. Retrieve your Redis credentials and connection parameters.
2. Use the credentials and connection parameters with your Redis node credentials in n8n.
