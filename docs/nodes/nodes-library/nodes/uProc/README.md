## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to take a screenshot of a website and send it to a Telegram channel. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/858) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [uProc]()
- [Telegram](../../nodes/Telegram/README.md)

The final workflow should look like the following image.

![A workflow with the uProc node](./workflow.png)

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. uProc node (getUrlScreenshot)


This node will return the screenshot of the n8n website. If you want to get the screenshot of a different website, enter the domain of that website instead.

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the uProc node. You can find out how to do that [here](../../../credentials/uProc/README.md).
2. Select 'Image' from the ***Resource*** dropdown list.
3. Select 'Get Screenshot by URL' from the ***Operation*** dropdown list.
4. Enter `https://n8n.io` in the ***URL*** field.
5. Select '1024' from the ***Width*** dropdown list.
6. Select 'Yes' from the ***Fullpage*** dropdown list.
7. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.


In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node returns a URL of the screenshot of the website.

![Using the uProc node to get a screenshot of a website](./uProc_node.png)

### 3. Telegram node (sendPhoto: message)

This node will send the screenshot that we received from the previous node.

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Telegram node. You can find out how to do that [here](../../../credentials/Telegram/README.md).
2. Select 'Send Photo' from the ***Operation*** dropdown list.
3. Enter a chat ID in the ***Chat ID*** field. Refer to the [FAQs](../../nodes/Telegram/README.md#how-do-i-get-the-chat-id) of the Telegram node to learn how to get the chat ID.
4. Click on the gears icon next to the ***Photo*** field and click on ***Add Expression***.
