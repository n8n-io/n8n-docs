### **Time Saved node**

Previously, teams could only track a single fixed time saved value for each workflow regardless of which path an execution takes. The new Time Saved node enables more precise time savings calculations where different execution paths will save different amounts of time.

With this release you can now:

- **Choose fixed value or dynamic time tracking**: Use fixed time saved for simple workflows, or use one or many time saved nodes to calculate savings dynamically based on the actual execution path taken
- **Configure per-item calculations**: When using the Time Saved node, choose whether to calculate time saved once for all items or multiply by the number of items processed

The new Time Saved node provides increased accuracy for complex workflows where different execution paths save different amounts of time.

![time saved node example](/_images/release-notes/time_saved_node_1.png)

n8n automatically totals the time from all Time Saved nodes executed during each workflow run and reports it within the insights dashboard.

### Major Version Change

n8n 2.0.0 is a hardening release, not a feature release. It strengthens n8n's position as an enterprise-grade platform with secure-by-default execution, removal of legacy options that caused edge-case bugs, and better performance under load. The goal is a more predictable foundation you can rely on for mission-critical workflows.

This release is currently in **beta**. There's no urgency to upgrade immediately — take time to review the breaking changes and assess your workflows using the migration tool before upgrading.

For the full story behind 2.0, read our [announcement blog post](https://blog.n8n.io/introducing-n8n-2-0/).

### Breaking changes

Version 2.0 includes breaking changes across security defaults, data handling, and configuration. Key changes include:

- Task runners enabled by default (Code node executions now run in isolated environments)
- Environment variable access blocked from Code nodes by default
- ExecuteCommand and LocalFileTrigger nodes disabled by default
- In-memory binary data mode removed

Review the complete list and migration guidance in the [v2.0 breaking changes docs.](https://docs.n8n.io/2-0-breaking-changes/)

### Before you upgrade

Use the **Migration Report** tool to identify workflow-level and instance-level issues that need attention before upgrading.

See the [v2.0 migration tool docs](https://docs.n8n.io/migration-tool-v2/) for details.

### Product updates

**Publish / Save workflow paradigm**

n8n 2.0 introduces a safer approach to updating live workflows. The `Save` button now preserves your edits without changing production. A new `Publish` button lets you explicitly push changes live when ready. See [Publish workflows](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/publish/) for details.

**Canvas and navigation improvements**

Subtle refinements to the workflow editor canvas and reorganized sidebar navigation.
