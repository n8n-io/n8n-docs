### Workflow Diff

For teams working across different environments, deployments often involve multiple people making changes at different times. Without a clear view of those changes, it’s easy to miss something important.

[Workflow Diff](/source-control-environments/using/compare-changes.md) gives you an easy and visual way to review workflow changes before you deploy them between environments.

With it, you can:

- Quickly see what’s been added, changed, or deleted, with clear colour highlights.
- Easily see important settings changes on a workflow.
- Check changes inside each node, and spot connector updates, with a side-by-side view of its settings.
- Get a quick count of all changes to understand the size of a deployment.

Workflow Diff eases the review and approval of changes before deployment, enabling teams to collaborate on workflows without breaking existing automations or disrupting production. It’s one step further in integrating DevOps best practices in n8n. 

Now available for Enterprise customers using Environments.

### **No more limit of active workflows and new self-hosted Business Plan**

We have rolled out a new pricing model to make it easier for builders of all sizes to adopt and scale automation with n8n.
<br><br>
_**What’s new**_
<br><br>
**No more limit of active workflows.**

All n8n plans, from Starter to Enterprise, now include unlimited users, workflows, and steps. Our pricing is based on the volume of executions. Meaning you can build and test as many workflows as you want, including complex, data-heavy, or long-running automations, without worrying about quotas. 
<br><br>
**New self-hosted Business Plan for growing teams**

Designed for SMBs and mid-sized companies, the Business Plan includes features such as: 

- 6 shared projects
- SSO, SAML and LDAP
- Different environments
- Global variables
- Version control using Git
- 30 days of Insights

Please note that this plan only includes support from our community forum. For dedicated support we recommend upgrading to our Enterprise plan.
<br><br>

**Enterprise pricing now scales with executions**

Enterprise plans no longer use workflow-based pricing, and is now also based on the volume of executions. 
<br><br>
**_What you need to do_**

To ensure these changes apply to your account, update your n8n instance to the latest version.
<br><br>

[Read the blog](https://blog.n8n.io/build-without-limits-everything-you-need-to-know-about-n8ns-new-pricing/) for full details.

### **Respond to Chat node**

With the [**Respond to Chat](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.respondtochat.md) node**, you can now access Human-in-the-Loop functionality natively in n8n Chat.

Enable conversational experiences where you can ask for clarification, request approval before taking further action, and get back intermediate results — all within a single workflow execution.

This unlocks multi-turn interactions that feel more natural and reduce the number of executions required. It is ideal for building interactive AI use cases like conversational forms, branched workflows based on user replies, and step-by-step approvals. 

🛠️ **How to:** 

- Add a **Chat Trigger** node and select **Using Respond Nodes** for the **Response mode**
- Place the **Respond to Chat** node anywhere in your workflow to send a message into the Chat and optionally wait for the user to input a response before continuing execution of the workflow steps.

### **Chat streaming**

No more waiting for full responses to load when using the n8n chat interface. **Streaming** now delivers AI-generated text replies word by word so users can read messages as they’re being generated. It feels faster, smoother, and more like what people expect from chat experiences.

Streaming is available in public chat views (hosted or embedded) and can be used in custom apps via webhook.

🛠️ How-to

Configure streaming in the Node Details View of these nodes:

- Chat Trigger node: Options>Add Field>Response Mode>Streaming
- Webhook node: Respond>Streaming
- AI Agent node: Add option> Enable streaming

### Improved instance user list with more visibility

The instance user list has been updated with a new table layout and additional details to help admins manage access more easily.

You can now:

- See total users and filter by name or email
- View which projects each user has access to
- Whether a user has enabled 2FA and sort based on that
- See the last active date for each user

This makes it easier to audit user activity, identify inactive accounts, and understand how access is distributed across your instance.
<br> 
<figure markdown="span">
    ![Improved instance user list with more visbility screenshot](/_images/release-notes/instance_user_list.png)
</figure>
<br>


### Webhook HTML responses

Starting with this release, if your workflow sends an HTML response to a webhook, n8n automatically wraps the content in an `<iframe>`. This is a security mechanism to protect the instance users.

This has the following implications:

- HTML renders in a sandboxed iframe instead of directly in the parent document.
- JavaScript code that attempts to access the top-level window or local storage will fail.
- Authentication headers aren't available in the sandboxed iframe (for example, basic auth). You need to use an alternative approach, like embedding a short-lived access token within the HTML.
- Relative URLs (for example, `<form action="/">`) won't work. Use absolute URLs instead.

<div class="n8n-new-features" markdown> 
### Built-in Metrics for AI Evaluations

Using evaluations is a best practice for any AI solution, and a must if reliability and predictability are business-critical. With this release, we’ve made it easier to set up evaluations in n8n by introducing a set of built-in metrics. These metrics can review AI responses and assign scores based on factors like correctness, helpfulness, and more.<br><br>


You can run regular evaluations and review scores over time as a way to monitor your AI workflow's performance. You can also compare results across different models to help guide model selection, or run evaluations before and after a prompt change to support data-driven, iterative building.
<br><br>
As with all evaluations in n8n, you’ll need a dataset that includes the inputs you want to test. For some evaluations, the dataset must also include expected outputs (ground truth) to compare against. The evaluation workflow runs each input through the portion you're testing to generate a response. The built-in metric scores each response based on the aspect you're measuring, allowing you to compare results before and after changes or track trends over time in the Evaluations tab. <br><br>

You can still define your own custom metrics, but for common use cases, the built-in options make it much faster to implement. <br><br>

🛠️ **How to:** 

1. Set up your evaluation as described [here](/advanced-ai/evaluations/metric-based-evaluations.md#how-it-works), using an **Evaluation** node as the trigger and another with the **Set Metrics** operation.
2. In the **Set Metrics** node, choose a metric from the dropdown list.
3. Define any additional parameters required for your selected metric. In most cases, this includes mapping the dataset columns to the appropriate fields.

📏 **Available built-in metrics:**

- **Correctness (AI-based):** Compares AI workflow-generated responses to expected answers. Another LLM acts as a judge, scoring the responses based on guidance you provide in the prompt.
- **Helpfulness (AI-based):** Evaluates how helpful a response is in relation to a user query, using an LLM and prompt-defined scoring criteria.
- **String Similarity:** Measures how closely the response matches the expected output by comparing strings. Useful for command generation or when output needs to follow a specific structure.
- **Categorization:** Checks whether a response matches an expected label, such as assigning items to the correct category.
- **Tools Used:** Verifies whether the AI agent called the tools you specified in your dataset. 
To enable this, make sure **Return Intermediate Steps** is turned on in your agent so the evaluation can access the tools it actually called.

🧠 Keep in mind

- Registered Community Edition enables analysis of one evaluation in the **Evaluations** tab which allows easy comparison of evaluation runs over time. Pro and Enterprise plans allow unlimited evaluations in the **Evaluations** tab.

### AI Agent Tool node

With the **AI Agent Tool** node we are introducing a simplified pattern for multi-agent orchestration that can be run in a single execution and stay entirely on one canvas. You can now connect multiple **AI Agent Tool** nodes to a primary **AI Agent** node, allowing it to supervise and delegate work across other specialized agents. 

This setup is especially useful for building complex systems that function like real-world teams, where a lead agent assigns parts of a task to specialists. You can even add multiple layers of agents directing other agents, just like you would have in a real multi-tiered organizational structure.  It also helps with prompt management by letting you split long, complex instructions into smaller, focused tasks across multiple agents. While similar orchestration was already possible using sub-workflows, AI Agent Tool nodes are a good choice when you want the interaction to happen within a single execution or prefer to manage and debug everything from a single canvas.

🛠️ **How to:**

- Add an **AI Agent** node to your workflow and click **+** to create a Tools connection.
- Search for and select the **AI Agent Tool** node from the Nodes Panel.
- Name the node clearly so the primary agent can reference it, then add a short description and prompt.
- Connect any LLMs, memory, and tools the agent needs to perform its role.
- Instruct the primary **AI Agent** on when to use the **AI Agent Tool** and to pass along relevant context in its prompt.

🧠 **Keep in mind:**

- The orchestrating agent does not pass full execution context by default. Any necessary context must be included in the prompt.

**AI Agent Tool** nodes makes it easier to build layered, agent-to-agent workflows without relying on sub-workflows, helping you move faster when building and debugging multi-agent systems.

### Enforce 2FA across your instance

Enterprise Instance owners can now enforce two-factor authentication (2FA) for all users in their instance.

Once enabled, any user who hasn’t set up 2FA will be redirected to complete the setup before they can continue using n8n. This helps organizations meet internal security policies and ensures stronger protection across the workspace.

This feature is available only on the Enterprise plan.

**Release date:** 2025-06-23



This release contains core updates, editor improvements, a new node, node updates, and bug fixes.

### Model Selector node

The [Model Selector node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.modelselector.md) gives you more control when working with multiple LLMs in your workflows.

Use it to determine which connected model should handle a given input, based on conditions like expressions or global variables. This makes it easier to implement model routing strategies, such as switching models based on performance, task type, cost, or availability.

🛠️ **How to:** Connect multiple model nodes to the Model Selector node, then configure routing conditions in the node’s settings.

🧠 **Keep in mind:** 

- Rules are evaluated in order. The first matching rule determines which model is used even if others would also match.
- As a sub-node, expressions behave differently here: they always resolves to the first item rather than resolving for each item in turn.

The Model Selector node is especially useful in evaluation or production scenarios where routing logic between models needs to adapt based on performance, cost, availability, or dataset-specific needs.

### Support for OIDC (OpenID Connect) authentication

You can now use OIDC (OpenID Connect) as an authentication method for Single Sign-On (SSO).

This gives enterprise teams more flexibility to integrate n8n with their existing identity providers using a widely adopted and easy-to-manage standard. OIDC is now available alongside SAML, giving Enterprises the choice to select what best fits their internal needs.

### Project admins can now commit to Git within environments

Project admins now have the ability to commit workflow and credential changes directly to Git through the environments feature. This update streamlines the workflow deployment process by giving project-level admins direct control over committing their changes. It also ensures that the those who know their workflows best can review and commit updates themselves, without needing to involve instance-level admins.

### Automatically name nodes

Default node names now update automatically based on the resource and operation selected, so you’ll always know what a node does at a glance.

This adds clarity to your canvas and saves time renaming nodes manually.

Don’t worry, automatic naming won’t break references. And, and if you’ve renamed a node yourself, we’ll leave it just the way you wrote it.

<br>

### Support for RAG extended with built-in templates

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can improve AI responses by providing language models access to data sources with up-to-date, domain-specific, or proprietary knowledge. RAG workflows typically rely on vector stores to manage and search this data efficiently.

To get the benefits of using vector stores, such as returning results based on semantic meaning rather than just keyword matches, you need a way to upload your data to the vector store and a way to query it. 

In n8n, uploading and querying vectors stores happens in two workflows. Now, you have an example to get your started and make implementation easier with the **RAG starter template**. 

- The **Load Data** workflow shows how to add data with the appropriate embedding model, split it into chunks with the [Default Data Loader](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader.md), and add metadata as desired.
- The **Retriever** workflow for querying data, shows how  agents and vector stores work together to help you define highly relevant results and save tokens using the **Question and Answer** tool.

Enable semantic search and the retrieval of unstructured data  for increased quality and relevance of AI responses. 

🛠️ **How to:** 

- Search for **RAG starter template** in the search bar of the Nodes panel to insert it into your workflow.

Learn more about implementing RAG in n8n [here](/advanced-ai/rag-in-n8n.md).

### Convert to sub-workflow

Large, monolithic workflows can slow things down. They’re harder to maintain, tougher to debug, and more difficult to scale. With sub-workflows, you can take a more modular approach, breaking up big workflows into smaller, manageable parts that are easier to reuse, test, understand, and explain.

Until now, creating sub-workflows required copying and pasting nodes manually, setting up a new workflow from scratch, and reconnecting everything by hand. **Convert to sub-workflow** allows you to simplify this process into a single action, so you can spend more time building and less time restructuring.

<br>
<video src="/_video/release-notes/convert_to_sub-workflow.mp4" controls width="100%"></video>
<br>

**How it works**

1. Highlight the nodes you want to convert to a sub-workflow. These must:
    - Be fully connected, meaning no missing steps in between them
    - Start from a single starting node
    - End with a single node
2. Right-click to open the context menu and select **Convert to sub-workflow**
    - Or use the shortcut: `Alt + X`
3. n8n will:
    - Open a new tab containing the selected nodes
    - Preserve all node parameters as-is
    - Replace the selected nodes in the original workflow with a **Call My Sub-workflow** node

*Note*: You will need to manually adjust the field types in the Start and Return nodes in the new sub-workflow.

This makes it easier to keep workflows modular, performant, and easier to maintain.

This release contains API updates, core changes, editor improvements, node updates, and bug fixes.

### API support for assigning users to projects

You can now use the API to add and update users within projects. This includes:

- Assigning existing or pending users to a project with a specific role
- Updating a user’s role within a project
- Removing users from one or more projects

This update now allows you to use the API to add users to both the instance and specific projects, removing the need to manually assign them in the UI. 

### Add pending users to project member assignment

You can now add **pending users,** those who have been invited but haven't completed sign-up, to projects as members.

This change lets you configure a user's project access upfront, without waiting for them to finish setting up their account. It eliminates the back-and-forth of managing access post-sign-up, ensuring users have the right project roles immediately upon joining.

### Evaluations for AI workflows

We’ve added a feature to help you iterate, test, and compare changes to your AI automations before pushing them to production so you can achieve more predictability and make better decisions.<br><br>

When you're building with AI, a small prompt tweak or model swap might improve results with some inputs, while quietly degrading performance with others. But without a way to evaluate performance across many inputs, you’re left guessing whether your AI is actually getting better when you make a change.  <br><br>

By implementing **Evaluations for AI workflows** in n8n, you can assess how your AI performs across a range of inputs by adding a dedicated path in your workflow for running test cases and applying custom metrics to track results. This helps you build viable proof-of-concepts quickly, iterate more effectively, catch regressions early, and make more confident decisions when your AI is in production.<br><br>


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5LlF196PKaE?si=TcwM0JyhjsRKDb3x" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<br><br>

#### Evaluation node and tab

The **Evaluation node** includes several operations that, when used together, enable end-to-end AI evaluation.

<br> 
<figure markdown="span">
    ![Evaluation node](/_images/release-notes/Evaluations_node.png)
    <figcaption>Evaluation node</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

Use this node to:

- Run your AI logic against a wide range of test cases in the same execution
- Capture the outputs of those test cases
- Score the results using your own metrics or LLM-as-judge logic
- Isolate a testing path to only include the nodes and logic you want to evaluate <br>

The **Evaluations tab** enables you to review test results in the n8n UI, perfect for comparing runs, spotting regressions, and viewing performance over time.
<br><br>

#### 🛠 How evaluations work

The evaluation path runs alongside your normal execution logic and only activates when you want—making it ideal for testing and iteration. <br><br>

Get started by selecting an AI workflow you want to evaluate that includes one or more LLM or Agent nodes. <br>

1. Add an **Evaluation** node with the **On new Evaluation event** operation. This node will act as an additional trigger you’ll run only when testing. Configure it to read your dataset from Google Sheets, with each row representing a test input.<br>

    > 💡  Better datasets mean better evaluations. Craft your dataset from a variety of test cases, including edge cases and typical inputs, to get meaningful feedback on how your AI performs. Learn more and access sample datasets [here](/advanced-ai/evaluations/light-evaluations.md/#1-create-a-dataset).

2. Add a second **Evaluation** node using the **Set Outputs** operation after the part of the workflow you're testing—typically after an LLM or Agent node. This captures the response and writes it back to your dataset in Google Sheets.
3. To evaluate output quality, add a third **Evaluation** node with the **Set Metrics** operation at a point after you’ve generated the outputs. You can develop workflow logic, custom calculations, or add an LLM-as-Judge to score the outputs. Map these metrics to your dataset in the node’s parameters. <br>

    > 💡 Well-defined metrics = smarter decisions. Scoring your outputs based on similarity, correctness, or categorization can help you track whether changes are actually improving performance. Learn more and get links to example templates [here](/advanced-ai/evaluations/metric-based-evaluations.md/#2-add-metrics-to-workflow). 
    
<br>

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Evaluation workflow](/_images/release-notes/Evaluations_workflow.png)
    <figcaption>Evaluation workflow</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

When the Evaluation trigger node is executed, it runs each input in our dataset through your AI logic. This continues until all test cases are processed, a limit is reached, or you manually stop the execution. Once your evaluation path is set up, you can update your prompt, model, or workflow logic—and re-run the Evaluation trigger node to compare results. If you’ve added metrics, they’ll appear in the Evaluations tab. <br><br>

In some instances, you may want to isolate your testing path to make iteration faster or to avoid executing downstream logic.  In this case, you can add an Evaluation node with the `Check If Evaluating` operation to ensure only the expected nodes run when performing evaluations. <br><br>

#### Things to keep in mind

Evaluations for AI Workflows are designed to fit  into your development flow, with more enhancements on the way. For now, here are a few things to note:

- Test datasets are currently managed through Google Sheets. You’ll need a Google Sheets credential to run evaluations.
- Each workflow supports one evaluation at a time. If you’d like to test multiple segments, consider splitting them into sub-workflows for more flexibility.
- Community Edition supports one single evaluation. Pro and Enterprise plans allow unlimited evaluations.
- AI Evaluations are not enabled for instances in scaling mode at this time. <br>

You can find details, tips, and common troubleshooting info [here](/advanced-ai/evaluations/tips-and-common-issues.md). <br><br>

**Release date:** 2025-05-19

This release contains editor improvements, an API update, node updates, new nodes, and bug fixes.

<div class="n8n-new-features" markdown> 

### Verified community nodes on Cloud

We’ve expanded the n8n ecosystem and unlocked a new level of flexibility for all users including those on n8n Cloud! Now you can access a select set of community nodes and partner integrations without leaving the canvas. This means you install and automate with a wider range of integrations without leaving your workspace. The power of the community is now built-in.

This update focuses on three major improvements:

- **Cloud availability**: Community nodes are no longer just for self-hosted users. A select set of nodes is now available on n8n Cloud.
- **Built-in discovery**: You can find and explore these nodes right from the Nodes panel without leaving the editor or searching on npm.
- **Trust and verification**: Nodes that appear in the editor have been manually vetted for quality and security. These verified nodes are marked with a checkmark.

We’re starting with a selection of around 25 nodes, including some of the most-used community-built packages and partner-supported integrations. For this phase, we focused on nodes that don’t include external package dependencies - helping streamline the review process and ensure a smooth rollout.
<br>
<br>

This is just the start. We plan to expand the library gradually, bringing even more verified nodes into the editor along with the powerful and creative use cases they unlock. In time, our criteria will evolve, opening the door to a wider range of contributions while keeping quality and security in focus.
<br>
<br>

Learn more about this update and find out which nodes are already installable from the editor in our [blog](https://blog.n8n.io/community-nodes-available-on-n8n-cloud/) post. 

<br>

 💻 **Use a verified node**

Make sure you're on **n8n version 1.94.0** or later and the instance Owner has enabled verified community nodes. On Cloud, this can be done from the Admin Panel. For self-hosted instances, please refer to [documentation](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes.md). In both cases, verified nodes are enabled by default.

- Open the **Nodes panel** from the editor
- Search for the Node. Verified nodes are indicated by a shield 🛡️
- Select the node and click **Install**

<br>
<video src="/_video/release-notes/Community-nodes-node-panel.mp4" controls width="100%"></video>
<br>

Once an Owner installs a node, everyone on the instance can start using it—just drag, drop, and connect like any other node in your workflow.

<br>

🛠️ **Build a node and get it verified**

Want your node to be verified and discoverable from the editor? Here’s how to get involved:

1. Review the [community node verification guidelines](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/verification-guidelines.md).
2. If you’re building something new, follow the recommendations for [creating nodes](/integrations/creating-nodes/overview.md).
3. Check your design against the [UX guidelines](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ux-guidelines.md).
4. [Submit your node](/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/submit-community-nodes.md) to npm.
5. Request verification by filling out [this form](https://internal.users.n8n.cloud/form/f0ff9304-f34a-420e-99da-6103a2f8ac5b).

<br>

**Already built a node? Raise your hand!**

If you’ve already published a community node and want it considered for verification, make sure it meets the requirements noted above, then let us know by submitting the interest [form](https://internal.users.n8n.cloud/form/f0ff9304-f34a-420e-99da-6103a2f8ac5b). We’re actively curating the next batch and would love to include your work.

</div> 


### Extended logs view

When workflows get complex, debugging can get... clicky. That’s where an extended **Logs View** comes in. Now you can get a clearer path to trace executions, troubleshoot issues, and understand the behavior of a complete workflow — without bouncing between node detail views. 

This update brings a unified, always-accessible panel to the bottom of the canvas, showing you each step of the execution as it happens. Whether you're working with loops, sub-workflows, or AI agents, you’ll see a structured view of everything that ran, in the order it ran—with input, output, and status info right where you need it.

You can jump into node details when you want to dig deeper, or follow a single item through every step it touched. Real-time highlighting shows you which nodes are currently running or have failed, and you’ll see total execution time for any workflow—plus token usage for AI workflows to help monitor performance. And if you're debugging across multiple screens? Just pop the logs out and drag them wherever you’d like.

⚙️**What it does**

- Adds a **Logs view** to the bottom of the canvas that can be opened or collapsed. (Chat also appears here if your workflow uses it).
- Displays a **hierarchical list of nodes** in the order they were executed—including expanded views of sub-workflows.
- Allows you to **click a node in hierarchy** to preview inputs and outputs directly, or jump into the full Node Details view with a link.
- Provides ability to **toggle** input and output data on and off.
- Highlights each node **live as it runs**, showing when it starts, completes, or fails.
- Includes **execution history** view to explore past execution data in a similar way.
- Shows **roll-up stats** like total execution time and total AI tokens used (for AI-enabled workflows).
- Includes a  **“pop out”** button to open the logs as a floating window—perfect for dragging to another screen while debugging.

🛠️**How to**

To access the expanded logs view, click on the Logs bar at the bottom of the canvas. The view is also opens up when you open the chat window on the bottom of the page.

⌨️ Keyboard shortcuts

- **Windows:** `CTRL + SHIFT + O` or `CTRL + Double Click`
- **Mac:** `CMD + SHIFT + O` or `CMD + Double Click`

These options will bring your sub-workflow up in a new tab.

### Archive workflows

If you’ve ever accidentally removed a workflow, you’ll appreciate the new archiving feature. Instead of permanently deleting workflows with the Remove action, workflows are now archived by default. This allows you to recover them if needed.

**How to:**

- **Archive a workflow** - Select **Archive** from the Editor UI menu. It has replaced the **Remove** action.
- **Find archived workflows** - Archived workflows are hidden by default. To find your archived workflows, select the option for **Show archived workflows** in the workflow filter menu.
- **Permanently delete a workflow** - Once a workflow is archived, you can **Delete** it from the  options menu.
- **Recover a workflow** - Select **Unarchive** from the options menu.

**Keep in mind:** 

- Workflows archival requires the same permissions as required previously for removal.
- You cannot select archived workflows as sub-workflows to execute
- Active workflows are deactivated when they are archived
- Archived workflows can not be edited

### Partial Execution for AI Tools

We’ve made it easier to build and iterate on AI agents in n8n. You can now run and test specific tools without having to execute the entire agent workflow.

Partial execution is especially useful when refining or troubleshooting parts of your agent logic. It allows you to test changes incrementally, without triggering full agent runs, reducing unnecessary AI calls, token usage, and downstream activity. This makes iteration faster, more cost-efficient, and more precise when working with complex or multi-step AI workflows.

Partial execution for AI tools is available now for all tools - making it even easier to build, test, and fine-tune AI agents in n8n.

<br>
<video src="/_video/release-notes/AI-agent-partial-execution.mp4" controls width="100%"></video>
<br>

**How to:**

To use this feature you can either:

- Click the **Play** button on the tool you want to execute directly from the canvas view.
- Open the tool’s **Node Details View** and select **"Execute Step"** to run it from there.

If you have previously run the workflow, the input and output will be prefilled with data from the last execution. A pop-up form will open where you can manually fill in the parameters before executing your test.

### Extended logs view

When workflows get complex, debugging can get... clicky. That’s where an extended **Logs View** comes in. Now you can get a clearer path to trace executions, troubleshoot issues, and understand the behavior of a complete workflow — without bouncing between node detail views. 

This update brings a unified, always-accessible panel to the bottom of the canvas, showing you each step of the execution as it happens. Whether you're working with loops, sub-workflows, or AI agents, you’ll see a structured view of everything that ran, in the order it ran—with input, output, and status info right where you need it.

You can jump into node details when you want to dig deeper, or follow a single item through every step it touched. Real-time highlighting shows you which nodes are currently running or have failed, and you’ll see total execution time for any workflow—plus token usage for AI workflows to help monitor performance. And if you're debugging across multiple screens? Just pop the logs out and drag them wherever you’d like.

⚙️**What it does**

- Adds a **Logs view** to the bottom of the canvas that can be opened or collapsed. (Chat also appears here if your workflow uses it).
- Displays a **hierarchical list of nodes** in the order they were executed—including expanded views of sub-workflows.
- Allows you to **click a node in hierarchy** to preview inputs and outputs directly, or jump into the full Node Details view with a link.
- Provides ability to **toggle** input and output data on and off.
- Highlights each node **live as it runs**, showing when it starts, completes, or fails.
- Includes **execution history** view to explore past execution data in a similar way.
- Shows **roll-up stats** like total execution time and total AI tokens used (for AI-enabled workflows).
- Includes a  **“pop out”** button to open the logs as a floating window—perfect for dragging to another screen while debugging.

🛠️**How to**

To access the expanded logs view, click on the Logs bar at the bottom of the canvas. The view is also opens up when you open the chat window on the bottom of the page.

### Insights enhancements for Enterprise

Two weeks after the launch of [Insights](/insights.md), we’re releasing some enhancements designed for enterprise users.

- **Expanded time ranges**. You can now filter insights over a variety of time periods, from the last 24 hours up to 1 year. Pro users are limited to 7 day and 14 day views.  
- **Hourly granularity**. Drill down into the last 24 hours of production executions with hourly granularity, making it easier to analyze workflows and quickly identify issues.  

These updates provide deeper visibility into workflow history, helping you uncover trends over longer periods and detect problems sooner with more precise reporting.

This release contains core updates, editor updates, node updates, performance improvements, and bug fixes.

### Extended HTTP Request tool functionality
We’ve brought the full power of the HTTP Request node to the HTTP Request tool in AI workflows. That means your AI Agents now have access to all the advanced configuration options—like Pagination, Batching, Timeout, Redirects, Proxy support, and even cURL import.

<br>
<video src="/_video/release-notes/http-request-tool.mp4" controls width="100%"></video>
<br>

This update also includes support for the `$fromAI` function to dynamically generate the right parameters based on the context of your prompt — making API calls smarter, faster, and more flexible than ever.

**How to:**

- Open your AI Agent node in the canvas.
- Click the **‘+’ icon** to add a new tool connection.
- In the **Tools panel**, select HTTP **Request Tool.**
- Configure it just like you would a regular **HTTP Request node** — including advanced options

👉 Learn more about configuring the [HTTP Request tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest.md).


### Scoped API keys
Users on the Enterprise plan can now create API keys with specific scopes to control exactly what each key can access.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Scoped API keys](/_images/release-notes/scoped-API-keys.png)
    <figcaption>Scoped API keys</figcaption>
</figure>

Previously, API keys had full read/write access across all endpoints. While sometimes necessary, this level of access can be excessive and too powerful for most use cases.  Scoped API keys allow you to limit access to only the resources and actions a service or user actually needs.

**What’s new**

When creating a new API key, you can now:

- Select whether the key has read, write, or both types of access.  
- Specify which resources the key can interact with.  

Supported scopes include:

- Variables — list, create, delete  
- Security audit — generate reports  
- Projects — list, create, update, delete  
- Executions — list, read, delete  
- Credentials — list, create, update, delete, move  
- Workflows — list, create, update, delete, move, add/remove tags  

Scoped API keys give you more control and security. You can limit access to only what’s needed, making it safer to work with third parties and easier to manage internal API usage.

### Drag and Drop in Folders

Folders just got friendlier. With this release, you can now **drag and drop workflows and folders** — making it even easier to keep things tidy.

Need to reorganize? Just select a workflow or folder and drag it into another folder or breadcrumb location. It’s a small change that makes a big difference when managing a growing collection of workflows.

<br>
<video src="/_video/release-notes/Drag-and-drop-folders.mp4" controls width="100%"></video>
<br>

📁 Folders are available to all [registered](/hosting/community-edition-features.md#registered-community-edition) users—jump in and get your workspace in order!

### Insights 

We're rolling out [Insights](/insights.md), a new dashboard to monitor how your workflows are performing over time. It's designed to give admins (and owners) better visibility of their most important workflow metrics and help troubleshoot potential issues and improvements. <br> 
<br>

In this first release, we’re introducing a summary banner, the insights dashboard, and time saved per execution. <br> <br>

#### 1. Summary banner
A new banner on the overview page that gives instance admins and owners a birds eye view of key metrics over the last 7 days.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Summary banner](/_images/release-notes/Insights-summary-banner.png)
    <figcaption>Insights summary banner</figcaption>
</figure>

Available metrics:

- Total production executions
- Total failed executions
- Failure rate
- Average runtime of all workflows
- Estimated time saved

This overview is designed to help you stay on top of workflow activity at a glance. It is available for all plans and editions. <br> <br>

#### 2. Insights dashboard
On Pro and Enterprise plans, a new dashboard offers a deeper view into workflow performance and activity. 

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Insights dashboard](/_images/release-notes/Insights-dashboard.png)
    <figcaption>Insights dashboard</figcaption>
</figure>

The dashboard includes:

- Total production executions over time, including a comparison of successful and failed executions
- Per-workflow breakdowns of key metrics
- Comparisons with previous periods to help spot changes in usage or behavior
- Runtime average and failure rate over time

#### 3. Time saved per execution
Within workflow settings, you can now assign a “time saved per execution” value to any workflow. This makes it possible to track the impact of your workflows and make it easier to share this visually with other teams and stakeholders.<br><br>

This is just the beginning for Insights: the next phase will introduce more advanced filtering and comparisons, custom date ranges, and additional monitoring capabilities. 

</div>

### Node updates
- We added a credential check for the Salesforce node
- We added SearXNG as a tool for AI agents

You can now search within subfolders, making it easier to find workflows across all folder levels. Just type in the search bar and go.

## n8n@1.88.0

View the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.87.0...n8n@1.88.0) for this version.<br />
**Release date:** 2025-04-10

This release contains new features, new nodes, performance improvements, and bug fixes.

<div class="n8n-new-features" markdown> 


### Model Context Protocol (MCP) nodes
MCP aims to standardise how LLMs like Claude, ChatGPT, or Cursor can interact with tools or integrate data for their agents. Many providers - both established or new - are adopting MCP as a standard way to build agentic systems. It is an easy way to either expose your own app as a server, making capabilities available to a model as tools, or as a client that can call on tools outside of your own system. <br>

While it’s still early in the development process, we want to give you access to our new MCP nodes. This will help us understand your requirements better and will also let us converge on a great general solution quicker. <br>

We are adding two new nodes: 

- a MCP [Server Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcptrigger.md) for any workflow  
- a MCP [Client Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolmcp.md) for the AI Agent  

The MCP Server Trigger turns n8n into an MCP server, providing n8n tools to models running outside of n8n. You can run multiple MCP servers from your n8n instance. The MCP Client Tool connects LLMs - and other intelligent agents - to any MCP-enabled service through a single interface. <br>

Max from our DevRel team created an official walkthrough for you to get started: 

<br>

</figure>


### MCP Server Trigger
The MCP Server Trigger turns n8n into an MCP server, providing n8n tools to models running outside of n8n. The node acts as an entry point into n8n for MCP clients. It operates by exposing a URL that MCP clients can interact with to access n8n tools. This means your n8n workflows and integrations are now available to models run elsewhere. Pretty neat.

    <figcaption>MCP Server Trigger</figcaption>
</figure>

[Explore the MCP Server Trigger docs](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcptrigger.md)

### MCP Client Tool
The MCP Client Tool node is a MCP client, allowing you to use the tools exposed by an external MCP server. You can connect the MCP Client Tool node to your models to call external tools with n8n agents. In this regard it is similar to using a n8n tool with your AI agent. One advantage is that the MCP Client Tool can access multiple tools on the MCP server at once, keeping your canvas cleaner and easier to understand.

### Folders
What can we say about folders? Well, they’re super handy for categorizing just about everything and they’re finally available for your n8n workflows. Tidy up your workspace with unlimited folders and nested folders. Search for workflows within folders. It’s one of the ways we’re making it easier to organize your n8n instances more effectively.  

**How to use it:** 

Create and manage folders within your personal space or within projects. You can also create workflows from within a folder. You may need to restart your instance in order to activate folders.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Folders](/_images/release-notes/Folders.png
)
    <figcaption>It's a folder alright</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

Folders are available for all [registered](/hosting/community-edition-features.md#registered-community-edition) users so get started with decluttering your workspace now and look for more features (like drag and drop) to organize your instances soon.

### Enhancements to Form Trigger Node

Recent updates to the Form Trigger node have made it a more powerful tool for building business solutions. These enhancements provide more flexibility and customization, enabling teams to create visually engaging and highly functional workflows with forms.

- **HTML customization:** Add custom HTML to forms, including embedded images and videos, for richer user experiences.  
- **Custom CSS support**: Apply custom styles to user-facing components to align forms with your brand’s look and feel. Adjust fonts, colors, and spacing for a seamless visual identity.
- **Form previews:** Your form’s description and title will pull into previews of your form when sharing on social media or messaging apps, providing a more polished look.  
- **Hidden fields:** Use query parameters to add hidden fields, allowing you to pass data—such as a referral source—without exposing it to the user.  
- **New responses options:** Respond to user submissions in multiple ways including text, HTML, or a downloadable file (binary format). This enables forms to display rich webpages or deliver digital assets such as dynamically generated invoices or personalized certificates.  

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Form with custom CSS applied](/_images/release-notes/Forms_with_custom_CSS_and_HTML.png)
    <figcaption>Form with custom CSS applied</figcaption>

### Schema Preview

Schema Preview lets you view and work with a node’s expected output without executing it or adding credentials, keeping you in flow while building.

- **See expected node outputs instantly.** View schemas for over 100+ nodes to help you design workflows efficiently without extra steps.  
- **Define workflow logic first, take care of credentials later.** Build your end-to-end workflow without getting sidetracked by credential setup.  
- **Avoid unwanted executions when building.** Prevent unnecessary API calls, unwanted data changes, or potential third-party service costs by viewing outputs without executing nodes.  

**How to use it:**

- Add a node with Schema Preview support to your workflow.
- Open the next node in the sequence - Schema Preview data appears in the Node Editor where you would typically find it in the Schema View.
- Use Schema Preview fields just like other schema data - drag and drop them into parameters and settings as needed.

Don’t forget to add the required credentials before putting your workflow into production.

### Tidy up
Tidy up instantly aligns nodes, centers stickies, untangles connections, and brings structure to your workflows. Whether you're preparing to share a workflow or just want to improve readability, this feature saves you time and makes your logic easier to follow. Clean, well-organized workflows aren't just nicer to look at—they’re also quicker to understand.

**How to:** 

Open the workflow you want to tidy, then choose one of these options:

- Click the **Tidy up** button in the bottom-left corner of the canvas (it looks like a broom 🧹)
- Press **Shift + Alt + T** on your keyboard
- Right-click anywhere on the canvas and select **Tidy up workflow**

Want to tidy up just part of your workflow? Select the specific nodes you want to clean up first - Tidy up will only adjust those, along with any stickies behind them.

<br>


### Multiple API keys
n8n now supports multiple API keys, allowing users to generate and manage separate keys for different workflows or integrations. This improves security by enabling easier key rotation and isolation of credentials. Future updates will introduce more granular controls. <br>

This release contains bug fixes, a core update, editor improvements, and a node update.

### Improved partial executions
The new execution engine for partial executions ensures that testing parts of a workflow in the builder closely mirrors production behaviour. This makes iterating with updated run-data faster and more reliable, particularly for complex workflows.

Before, user would test parts of a workflow in the builder that didn't consistently reflect production behaviour, leading to unexpected results during development.

This update aligns workflow execution in the builder with production behavior.

Here is an example for loops:

### Improved consistency across environments
We added new UX and automatic changes improvements resulting in a better consistency between your staging and production instances.

Previously, users faced issues like:  

- Lack of visibility into required credential updates when pulling changes  
- Incomplete synchronization, where changes — such as deletions — weren’t always applied across environments  
- Confusing commit process, making it unclear what was being pushed or pulled  

We addressed these by:

- Clearly indicating required credential updates when pulling changes  
- Ensuring deletions and other modifications sync correctly across environments  
- Improving commit selection to provide better visibility into what’s being pushed

### Overhauled Code node editing experience
We added a ton of new helpers to the Code node, making edits of your code much faster and more comfortable. You get:

- TypeScript autocomplete  
- TypeScript linting  
- TypeScript hover tips  
- Search and replace  
- New keyboard shortcuts based on the VSCode keymap  
- Auto-formatting using prettier (Alt+Shift+F)  
- Remember folded regions and history after refresh  
- Multi cursor  
- Type function in the Code node using JSDoc types  
- Drag and drop for all Code node modes  
- Indentation markers  

We build this on a web worker architecture so you won't have to suffer from performance degradation while typing. <br>
<br>
To get the full picture, check out our Studio update with Max and Elias, where they discuss and demo the new editing experience. 👇 <br>

### New node: Microsoft Entra ID
Microsoft Entra ID (formerly known as Microsoft Azure Active Directory or Azure AD) is used for cloud-based identity and access management. [The new node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftentra.md) supports a wide range of Microsoft Entra ID features, which includes creating, getting, updating, and deleting users and groups, as well as adding users to and removing them from groups. 

### Node updates

- [AI Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index.md): Vector stores can now be directly used as tools for the agent
- [Code](/code/builtin/overview.md): Tons of new speed and convenience features, see above for details  
- [Google Vertex Chat](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatgooglevertex.md): Added option to specify the GCP region for the Google API credentials  
- [HighLevel](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.highlevel.md): Added support for calendar items  


We also added a custom [projects](/user-management/rbac/projects.md) icon selector on top of the available emojis. Pretty!

We also added credential support for [SolarWinds IPAM](/integrations/builtin/credentials/solarwindsipam.md) and [SolarWinds Observability](/integrations/builtin/credentials/solarwindsobservability.md). 

Last, but not least, we [improved the schema view performance in the node details view by 90%](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/12180) and added drag and drop re-ordering to parameters. This comes in very handy in the [If](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if.md) or [Edit Fields](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set.md) nodes.

This release contains node updates, performance improvements, and bug fixes.

<div class="n8n-new-features" markdown>

### Task runners for the Code node in public beta
We're introducing a significant performance upgrade to the Code node with our new Task runner system. This enhancement moves JavaScript code execution to a separate process, improving your workflow execution speed while adding better isolation.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Task runners overview](/_images/hosting/configuration/task-runner-concept.png)
    <figcaption>Task runners overview</figcaption>
</figure>

Our benchmarks show up to 6x improvement in workflow executions using Code nodes - from approximately 6 to 35 executions per second. All these improvements happen under the hood, keeping your Code node experience exactly the same.

The Task runner comes in two modes:

- Internal mode (default): Perfect for getting started, automatically managing task runners as child processes  
- External mode: For advanced hosting scenarios requiring maximum isolation and security

Currently, this feature is opt-in and can be enabled using [environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/task-runners.md). Once stable, it will become the default execution method for Code nodes.

To start using Task runners today, [check out the docs](/hosting/configuration/task-runners.md).

</div>

### Node updates

- [AI Transform node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aitransform.md): We improved the prompt for code generation to transform data
- [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/index.md): We added a warning if `pairedItem` is absent or could not be auto mapped

**Release date:** 2024-11-27

This release contains node updates, performance improvements and bug fixes.

### New canvas in beta
The new canvas is now the default setting for all users. It should bring significant performance improvements and adds a handy minimap. As it is still a beta version you can still revert to the previous version with the three dot menu.  

We're looking forward to your feedback. Should you encounter a bug, you will find a handy button to create an issue at the bottom of the new canvas as well. 

### Node updates
- We added credential support for [Zabbix](/integrations/builtin/credentials/zabbix.md) to the HTTP request node  
- We added new OAuth2 credentials for [Microsoft SharePoint](/integrations/builtin/credentials/microsoft.md)
- The [Slack node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack.md#operations) now uses markdown for the approval message when using the `Send and Wait for Approval` operation

### New node: n8n Form
Use the [n8n Form node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form.md) to create user-facing forms with multiple pages. You can add other nodes with custom logic between to process user input. Start the workflow with a [n8n Form Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger.md). 

<figure markdown="span">

    <figcaption>A multi-page form with branching</figcaption>
</figure>

Additionally you can: 

- Set default selections with query parameters  
- Define the form with a JSON array of objects
- Show a completion screen and redirect to another URL

</div>

### Node updates
New nodes: 

- [Google Business Profile](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebusinessprofile.md) and [Google Business Profile Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebusinessprofiletrigger.md): Use these to integrate Google Business Profile reviews and posts with your workflows  

Enhanced nodes:

- [AI Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index.md): Removed the requirement to add at least one tool  
- [GitHub](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.github.md): Added workflows as a resource operation  
- [Structured Output Parser](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/index.md): Added more user-friendly error messages

For additional security, we improved how we handle multi-factor authentication, hardened config file permissions and introduced JWT for the public API. 

For better performance, we improved how partial executions are handled in loops.

### Enhanced node: Remove Duplicates
The [Remove Duplicates node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/index.md) got a major makeover with the addition of two new operations: 

- Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions: Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates  
- Clear Deduplication History: Wipe the memory of items from previous executions.

This makes it easier to only process new items from any data source. For example, you can now more easily poll a Google sheet for new entries by `id` or remove duplicate orders from the same customer by comparing their `order date`. The great thing is, you can now do this within **and across** workflow runs. 

</div>

### New node: Gong
  
The new node for [Gong](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gong.md) allows you to get users and calls to process them further in n8n. Very useful for sales related workflows.

/// warning | [Breaking change](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md)
What changed?

- The worker server used to bind to IPv6 by default. It now binds to IPv4 by default.  
- The worker server's `/healthz` used to report healthy status based on database and Redis checks. It now reports healthy status regardless of database and Redis status, and the database and Redis checks are part of `/healthz/readiness`.  

When is action necessary?

- If you experience a port conflict error when starting a worker server using its default port, set a different port for the worker server with `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_PORT`.  
- If you are relying on database and Redis checks for worker health status, switch to checking `/healthz/readiness` instead of `/healthz`.  
///

This release contains new features, node enhancements and bug fixes.

### Node updates

- [OpenAI](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/index.md): Added the option to choose between the default memory connector to provide memory to the assistant or to specify a thread ID    
- [Gmail](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/index.md) and [Slack](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack.md): Added custom approval operations to have a human in the loop of a workflow  

We have also optimized the [worker health checks](/hosting/logging-monitoring/monitoring.md) (see breaking change above). 

Each credential now has a seperate url you can link to. This makes sharing much easier.

#### Additional nodes as tools

We have made additional nodes usable with the [Tools AI Agent node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent.md). 
<br /><br />

<video src="/_video/release-notes/nodes-as-tools.mp4" controls width="100%"></video>
<br /><br />
Additionally, we have added a `$fromAI()` placeholder function to use with tools, allowing you to dynamically pass information from the models to the connected tools. This function works similarly to placeholders used elsewhere in n8n. 
<br /><br />
Both of these new features enable you to build even more powerful AI agents by drawing directly from the apps your business uses. This makes integrating LLMs into your business processes even easier than before.

/// warning | Breaking change
Calling `$(...).last()` (or `(...).first()` or `$(...).all()`) without arguments now returns the last item (or first or all items) of the output that connects two nodes. Previously, it returned the item/items of the first output of that node. Refer to the [breaking changes log](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md#1470) for details.

/// note | Backup recommended
Although this release doesn't include a breaking change, it is a significant update including database migrations. n8n recommends backing up your data before updating to this version.
///

/// Note | Credential sharing required for manual executions
Instance owners and admins: you will see changes if you try to manually execute a workflow where the credentials aren't shared with you. Manual workflow executions now use the same permissions checks as production executions, meaning you can't do a manual execution of a workflow if you don't have access to the credentials. Previously, owners and admins could do manual executions without credentials being shared with them. To resolve this, the credential creator needs to [share the credential](/credentials/credential-sharing.md) with you.
///

<div class="n8n-new-features" markdown>

#### New feature: Projects

With projects and roles, you can give your team access to collections of workflows and credentials, rather than having to share each workflow and credential individually. Simultaneously, you tighten security by limiting access to people on the relevant team.
<br /><br />
Refer to the [RBAC](/user-management/rbac/index.md) documentation for information on creating projects and using roles.
<br /><br />
The number of projects and role types vary depending on your plan. Refer to [Pricing](https://n8n.io/pricing/) for details.

#### New node: Slack Trigger

This release adds a trigger node for Slack. Refer to the [Slack Trigger documentation](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger.md) for details.

</div>

### Other highlights

* Improved [memory support for OpenAI assistants](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/index.md).

### Rolling back to a previous version

If you update to this version, then decide you need to role back:

Self-hosted n8n:

1. Delete any RBAC projects you created.
2. Revert the database migrations using `n8n db:revert`.

Cloud: contact [help@n8n.io](mailto:help@n8n.io).

/// warning | Breaking change
Please note that this version contains a breaking change for instances using a Postgres database.

<div class="n8n-new-features" markdown>

#### New feature: Ask AI in the HTTP node

You can now ask AI to help create API requests in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Ask AI**.
1. Enter the **Service** and **Request** you want to use. For example, to use the NASA API to get their picture of the day, enter `NASA` in **Service** and `get picture of the day` in **Request**.
1. Check the parameters: the AI tries to fill them out, but you may still need to adjust or correct the configuration.

Self-hosted users need to [enable AI features and provide their own API keys](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/index.md)

**Release date:** 2024-01-03

This release contains new nodes, node enhancements, new features, and bug fixes.

<div class="n8n-new-features" markdown>

#### New nodes and improved experience for working with files

This release includes a major overhaul of nodes relating to files (binary data).

There are now three key nodes dedicated to handling binary data files:

- [Read/Write Files from Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile.md) to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running.
- [Convert to File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile.md) to take input data and output it as a file.
- [Extract From File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile.md) to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.

n8n has moved support for iCalendar, PDF, and spreadsheet formats into these nodes, and removed the iCalendar, Read PDF, and Spreadsheet File nodes. There are still standalone nodes for [HTML](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html.md) and [XML](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xml.md).

</div>

<div class="n8n-new-features" markdown>

#### New node: Qdrant vector store

This release adds support for [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) with the Qdrant vector store node.

Read n8n's [Qdrant vector store node documentation](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstoreqdrant.md)

## LangChain in n8n (beta)

**Release date:** 2023-10-04

This release introduces support for building with LangChain in n8n.

With n8n's LangChain nodes you can build AI-powered functionality within your workflows. The LangChain nodes are configurable, meaning you can choose your preferred agent, LLM, memory, and other components. Alongside the LangChain nodes, you can connect any n8n node as normal: this means you can integrate your LangChain logic with other data sources and services.

Read more:

* This is a beta release, and not yet available in the main product. Follow the instructions in [Access LangChain in n8n](/advanced-ai/langchain/overview.md) to try it out. Self-hosted and Cloud options are available.
* Learn how LangChain concepts map to n8n nodes in [LangChain concepts in n8n](/advanced-ai/langchain/langchain-n8n.md).
* Browse n8n's new [Cluster nodes](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/index.md). This is a new set of node types that allows for multiple nodes to work together to configure each other.

### Highlights

<div class="n8n-new-features" markdown>

#### Python support

Although JavaScript remains the default language, you can now also select Python as an option in the [Code node](/code/code-node.md) and even make use of [many Python modules](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html#packages-in-pyodide). Note that Python is unavailable in Code nodes added to a workflow before v1.0.
