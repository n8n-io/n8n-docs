### Human-in-the-loop for AI tool calls

You can now require explicit human approval before an AI Agent executes specific tools.

Human-in-the-loop (HITL) for AI tool calls enforces review directly at the tool level. A gated tool cannot execute unless a human explicitly approves the action, giving you deterministic control over high-impact operations like deleting records, writing to production systems, or sending high-impact emails. This removes the uncertainty of prompt-based safeguards and insulates you from probabilistic agent behavior.

Because the review step is implemented using standard n8n integrations, approvals are not limited to a single user or interface. Decisions can be routed across people and systems, enforcing approval from the right person using the channels they already work in.

#### What you can do

- Require explicit human approval for any tool the agent can call, including the MCP Client tool or sub-workflows exposed as tools
- Apply approval selectively, so some tools execute autonomously while others require review
- Route approvals across users and channels (for example, send a Slack-initiated action for approval by another user via email)
- Add safety checks for high-impact or potentially destructive operations without complex workflow patterns or brittle prompt logic.

#### How to use it

Start with a workflow where an AI Agent is connected to one or more tools.

1. On the connection from the AI Agent to the tool you want to gate, click the **+** icon and choose **Add human review step** (hovering over the icon shows the tooltip).
2. The **Tools panel** opens with nodes you can use to handle the review step. Select the one you want to use.
3. Configure the approval step in the added node’s parameters. Depending on the integration, you can define the approver, the message they receive, the available actions (for example, approve or deny), and the associated buttons.

### Chat node: human-in-the-loop actions

The **Chat** node now includes two new Actions for human-in-the-loop interactions in agentic workflows:

- **Send a message**: send a message to the user and continue the workflow
- **Send a message and wait for response**: send a message and pause execution until the user replies. Users can respond with free text in the Chat or by clicking inline approval buttons, as defined in the node’s configuration.

These Actions can be used as deterministic workflow steps or as tools for an **AI Agent**, enabling multi-turn human interaction within a single execution when using the **Chat Trigger**.

When used as an agent tool, the agent can ask for clarification before proceeding, helping it better interpret user intent and follow instructions. Agents can also send updates during long-running workflows using these Actions.

#### How to

1. Trigger your workflow with the **Chat Trigger** node. In the node parameters, add the *Response Mode* option and set it to *Using Response Nodes*.
2. Add a **Chat** node later in the workflow, or add it as a tool for an **AI Agent**. Select one of the following operations: *Send a message* or *Send a message and wait for response*.

#### Keep in mind

- If you want an AI Agent to choose between sending a message or waiting for input, add two **Chat** tool nodes, one for each action.
- For AI Agents triggered by the **Chat Trigger** node, adding **Send a message and wait for response** is recommended so the agent can request clarification when needed.

Learn more in the [Chat node documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chat/#operation).

### TLS support for Syslog log streaming

The Syslog log streaming destination now supports TLS over TCP for encrypted connections. This enables secure log streaming to enterprise SIEM and observability platforms that require encrypted transport. With this release, log streaming is now compatible with a broader range of enterprise SIEM platforms.

### Update credentials via API

n8n's public API now supports updating existing credentials by ID via a new *PATCH /credentials/:id* endpoint. Previously, credentials could only be created through the API so any changes required deleting and recreating the credential.

When updating, you can either replace all credential data at once (useful for bulk updates) or set *isPartialData: true* to merge changes with existing data. Ideal for automated secret rotation or fixing individual values without losing your configuration.

### More granular workflow permissions within Custom Project Roles (Enterprise)

Custom Project Roles allow you to define fine-grained permissions at the project level. With this release, workflow permissions have been further refined by separating workflow editing from workflow publishing.

This change makes it easier to align access controls with internal processes where building workflows and publishing them are handled by different users or teams.

### Log streaming: More audit events for improved observability

Log streaming now includes additional audit events to improve visibility into operational and security-relevant changes.

This update adds events for manual workflow cancellations and workflow activation/deactivation (publish/unpublish), variable lifecycle events (create/update/delete), and user management actions (including enabling/disabling 2FA). 

Workflow settings updates are also logged with the specific parameters that changed (for example, selecting a new error workflow), instead of a generic “updated” event.

### **Time Saved node**

Previously, teams could only track a single fixed time saved value for each workflow regardless of which path an execution takes. The new Time Saved node enables more precise time savings calculations where different execution paths will save different amounts of time.

With this release you can now:

- **Choose fixed value or dynamic time tracking**: Use fixed time saved for simple workflows, or use one or many time saved nodes to calculate savings dynamically based on the actual execution path taken
- **Configure per-item calculations**: When using the Time Saved node, choose whether to calculate time saved once for all items or multiply by the number of items processed

The new Time Saved node provides increased accuracy for complex workflows where different execution paths save different amounts of time.

![time saved node example](/_images/release-notes/time_saved_node_1.png)

n8n automatically totals the time from all Time Saved nodes executed during each workflow run and reports it within the insights dashboard.

### Major Version Change

n8n 2.0.0 is a hardening release, not a feature release. It strengthens n8n's position as an enterprise-grade platform with secure-by-default execution, removal of legacy options that caused edge-case bugs, and better performance under load. The goal is a more predictable foundation you can rely on for mission-critical workflows.

This release is currently in **beta**. There's no urgency to upgrade immediately — take time to review the breaking changes and assess your workflows using the migration tool before upgrading.

For the full story behind 2.0, read our [announcement blog post](https://blog.n8n.io/introducing-n8n-2-0/).

### Breaking changes

Version 2.0 includes breaking changes across security defaults, data handling, and configuration. Key changes include:

- Task runners enabled by default (Code node executions now run in isolated environments)
- Environment variable access blocked from Code nodes by default
- ExecuteCommand and LocalFileTrigger nodes disabled by default
- In-memory binary data mode removed

Review the complete list and migration guidance in the [v2.0 breaking changes docs.](https://docs.n8n.io/2-0-breaking-changes/)

### Before you upgrade

Use the **Migration Report** tool to identify workflow-level and instance-level issues that need attention before upgrading.

See the [v2.0 migration tool docs](https://docs.n8n.io/migration-tool-v2/) for details.

### Product updates

**Publish / Save workflow paradigm**

n8n 2.0 introduces a safer approach to updating live workflows. The `Save` button now preserves your edits without changing production. A new `Publish` button lets you explicitly push changes live when ready. See [Publish workflows](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/publish/) for details.

**Canvas and navigation improvements**

Subtle refinements to the workflow editor canvas and reorganized sidebar navigation.
