### New features

Notable new features.

#### Resource mapper UI component

This release includes a new UI component, the resource mapper. This component is useful for node creators. If your node does insert, update, or upsert operations, you need to send data from the node in a format supported by the service you're integrating with. Often it's necessary to use a Set node before a node that sends data, to get the data to match the schema of the service you're connecting to. The resource mapper UI component provides a way to get data into the required format directly within the node.

Refer to [Node user interface elements | Resource mapper](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements.md#resource-mapper) for guidance for node builders.

/// note | Upgrade to 0.222.1
Upgrade directly to 0.222.1.
///
### New features

<div class="n8n-new-features" markdown>

This release introduces improvements to the execution lists. You can now save [Custom execution data](/workflows/executions/custom-executions-data.md), and use it to filter both the [All executions](/workflows/executions/all-executions.md) and [Single workflow executions](/workflows/executions/single-workflow-executions.md) lists.

View the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.186.1...n8n@0.187.0){:target=_blank .external-link} for this version.<br />
**Release date:** 2022-07-20

This release includes several major new features, including:

* The community nodes repository: a new way to build and share nodes.
* Data pinning and data mapping: accelerate workflow development with better data manipulation functionality.

### New features

<div class="n8n-new-features" markdown>

#### Community nodes repository

This release introduces the [community node repository](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/index.md). This allows developers to build and share nodes as npm packages. Users can install community-built nodes directly in n8n.

</div>

<div class="n8n-new-features" markdown>

#### Data pinning

[Data pinning](/data/data-pinning.md) allows you to freeze and edit data during workflow development. Data pinning means saving the output data of a node, and using the saved data instead of fetching fresh data in future workflow executions. This avoids repeated API calls when developing a workflow, reducing calls to external systems, and speeding up workflow development.

</div>

<div class="n8n-new-features" markdown>

#### Data mapping

This release introduces a drag and drop interface for [data mapping](/data/data-mapping/index.md), as a quick way to map data without using expressions.

</div>

<div class="n8n-new-features" markdown>

#### Simplify authentication setup for node creators

This release introduces a simpler way of handling authorization when building a node. All credentials should now contain an `authenticate` property that dictates how the credential is used in a request.
n8n has also simplified authentication types: instead of specifying an authentication type and using the correct interface, you can now set the type as `"generic"`, and use the `IAuthenticateGeneric` interface.

You can use this approach for any authentication method where data is sent in the header, body, or query string. This includes methods like bearer and basic auth. You can't use this approach for more complex authentication types that require multiple calls, or for methods that don't pass authentication data. This includes OAuth.

For an example of the new authentication syntax, refer to n8n's [Asana node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/credentials/AsanaApi.credentials.ts){:target=_blank .external-link}.

```js
// in AsanaApi.credentials.ts
import {
	IAuthenticateGeneric,
	ICredentialType,
	INodeProperties,
} from 'n8n-workflow';

export class AsanaApi implements ICredentialType {
	name = 'asanaApi';
	displayName = 'Asana API';
	documentationUrl = 'asana';
	properties: INodeProperties[] = [
		{
			displayName: 'Access Token',
			name: 'accessToken',
			type: 'string',
			default: '',
		},
	];

	authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {
		type: 'generic',
		properties: {
			headers: {
				Authorization: '=Bearer {{$credentials.accessToken}}',
			},
		},
	};
}
```
</div>

#### Other new features

* Added a `preAuthentication` method to credentials.
* Added more credentials tests.
* Introduce automatic fixing for paired item information in some scenarios.

### Node enhancements

* [ERPNext node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.erpnext.md): add credential tests, and add support for unauthorized certs.
* [Google Drive node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googledrive/index.md): add support for move to trash.
* [Mindee node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mindee.md): support new version.

* [Shopify node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.shopify.md): add OAuth support.

### Bug fixes

* API: add missing node settings parameters.
* API: validate static data value for resource workflow.
* Baserow Node: fix an issue preventing table names from loading.
* Editor: hide the **Execute previous node** button when in read-only mode.
* Editor: hide tabs if there's only one branch.
* Roundup of link fixes in nodes.

## n8n@0.178.0

View the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.177.0...n8n@0.178.0){:target=_blank .external-link} for this version.<br />
**Release date:** 2022-05-24

This release adds support for reusing existing credentials in the HTTP Request node, making it easier to do custom operation with APIs where n8n already has an integration.

The release also includes improvements to the nodes view, giving better detail about incoming data, as well as some bug fixes.

### New features

<div class="n8n-new-features" markdown>

#### Credential reuse for custom API operations

n8n supplies hundreds of nodes, allowing you to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the HTTP Request node.

One of the most complex parts of setting up API calls is managing authentication. To simplify this, n8n now provides a way to use existential credential types (credentials associated with n8n nodes) in the HTTP Request node.

For more information, refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/custom-operations.md){:target=_blank}.

#### Node details view

An improved node view, showing more detail about node inputs.

</div>

### Node enhancements

[Salesforce Node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.salesforce.md){:target=_blank}: Add the **Country** field.

**Release date:** 2022-05-02

This release adds support for node versioning, along with node enhancements and bug fixes.



### New features

<div class="n8n-new-features" markdown>

#### Node versioning

0.175.0 adds support for a lightweight method of node versioning. One node can contain multiple versions, allowing small version increments without code duplication. To use this feature, change the `version` parameter in your node to an array, and add your version numbers, including your existing version. You can then access the version parameter with `@version` in your `displayOptions` (to control which version n8n displays). You can also query the version in your `execute` function using `const nodeVersion = this.getNode().typeVersion;`.

</div>

### Node enhancements

* [Google Sheets node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/index.md): n8n now handles header names formatted as JSON paths.

* [Telegram node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/index.md): add support for querying chat administrators.

### Bug fixes

* **core**: fixed an issue that was causing n8n to apply authentication checks, even when user management was disabled.
* **core**: n8n now skips credentials checks for disabled nodes.
* **editor**: fix a bug affecting touchscreen monitors.
* [HubSpot node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.hubspot.md): fix for search operators.
* [SendGrid node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sendgrid.md): fixed an issue with sending attachments.
* [Wise node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wise.md): respect the time parameter on `get: exchangeRate`.

For a comprehensive list of changes, view the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n%400.167.0...n8n@0.168.0) for this version.<br />
**Release date:** 2022-03-14

### New feature: user management

User management in n8n allows you to invite people to work in your self-hosted n8n instance. It includes:

* Login and password management

Check out the [user management documentation](/user-management/index.md) for more information.

## n8n@0.167.0

For a comprehensive list of changes, view the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n%400.166.0...n8n@0.167.0) for this version.<br />
**Release date:** 2022-03-13

### Highlights

#### Luxon and JMESPath

0.167.0 adds support for two new libraries:

* [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/): a JavaScript library for working with date and time
* [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/): a query language for JSON

You can use Luxon and JMESPath in the code editor and in expressions.

#### New expressions variables

We've added two new variables to simplify working with date and time in expressions:

* `$now`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp. Equivalent to DateTime.now().
* `$today`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).

#### Negative operations in If and Switch nodes

Made it easier to perform negative operations on strings.

This release adds one new operation for numbers:

* Is Not Empty

And the following new operations for strings:

* Not Ends With
* Regex Not Match
* Not Starts With
* Is Not Empty

Additionally, Regex is now labelled Regex Match.

#### New node: Redis Trigger

Added a Redis Trigger node, so you can now start workflows based on a Redis event.

* [Redis Trigger:](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.redistrigger.md) Added a Redis Trigger node.

### Core functionality

- Added support for [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/) and [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/).
- Added two new expressions variables, `$now` and `$today`.
- Added more negative operations for numbers and strings.
- Added a link to the course from the help menu.
