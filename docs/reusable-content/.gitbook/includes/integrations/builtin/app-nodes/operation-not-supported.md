## What to do if your operation isn't supported <a href="#what-to-do-if-your-operation-isnt-supported" id="what-to-do-if-your-operation-isnt-supported"></a>

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](https://app.gitbook.com/s/BKcbOzIWja8NfqKDcqHc/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node: 

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
1. Select the service you want to connect to.
1. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](https://app.gitbook.com/s/BKcbOzIWja8NfqKDcqHc/builtin/custom-api-actions-for-existing-nodes) for more information.
