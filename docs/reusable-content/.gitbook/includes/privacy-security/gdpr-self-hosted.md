If you self-host n8n, you are responsible for deleting user data. If you need to delete data on behalf of one of your users, you can delete the respective execution. n8n recommends configuring n8n to prune execution data automatically every few days to avoid effortful GDPR request handling as much as possible. Configure this using the `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE` environment variable. Refer to [Environment variables](https://app.gitbook.com/s/jm0ZYRpZIPWge2ZSiDYO/host-n8n/configure-n8n/basic-configuration/use-environment-variables) for more information.
