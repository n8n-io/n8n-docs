# Compare changes with workflow diffs

Workflow diffs allow you to visually compare changes between the workflow you have on an instance and the most recent version saved in your connected Git repository. This helps you understand the exact changes to the workflow before you decide to either push or pull it across different environments.

/// note | Feature availability
- Available on Enterprise
- Workflow diffs are only available when the environments features has been enabled on an instance
///

## Accessing workflow diffs

You can access workflow diffs from two locations:

1. **When pushing changes**: Click the workflow diff icon in the commit modal alongside the workflow you want to review
2. **When pulling changes**: Click the workflow diff in the modified changes modal alongside the workflow you want to review

## Understanding the workflow diff view

When you open a workflow diff, n8n displays two workflows vertically above and below:

### When pushing
* **Remote version in Git** (top panel): Latest version in your Git repository
* **Local Instance version** (bottom panel): Current locally saved version of the workflow

### When pulling  
* **Local instance version** (top panel): Current version on your n8n instance
* **Remote version in Git** (bottom panel): Version being pulled from the Git repository

The diff view highlights three types of changes:

* **Added nodes and connectors**: Any new node additions or connectors will show as green
* **Modified nodes and connectors**: Any modifications to existing nodes or connectors will show as orange
* **Deleted nodes and connectors**: Any nodes or connectors that have been deleted will show as red

## Reviewing node changes

For modified nodes, you can also look at the specific changes by doing the following:

1. Click on any modified node
2. A JSON diff appears showing all changes for that specific node
3. This allows you to review exactly what configuration changes were made

## Viewing summary of changes

In the top right, you will see a "changes" button showing a count of the number of changes:

1. Click the **Changes** button in the top right of the diff view
2. This shows the total breakdown of changes across:
   - Node changes
   - Node connector changes  
   - General workflow settings changes

## Navigating through each change

Use the navigation controls to review changes systematically:

* **Next/Previous arrows**: Cycle through each individual change
* **Back button**: Return to the previous view to select a different workflow

## Who can use workflow diffs

/// note | Workflow diffs require push or pull permissions
Only users who can push commits to an instance can access workflow diffs: instance owners, instance admins, and project admins.
