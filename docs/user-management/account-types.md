# Account types

There are three account types: owner, admin, and member. The account type affects the user permissions and access.

/// info | Feature availability
To use admin accounts, you need a pro or enterprise plan.
///

/// note | Account types and role types
Account types and role types are different things. Role types are part of [RBAC](/user-management/rbac/index.md). 

Every account has one type. The account can have different [role types](/user-management/rbac/role-types.md) for different [projects](/user-management/rbac/projects.md).
///

/// note | Create a member-level account for the owner
n8n recommends that owners create a member-level account for themselves. Owners can see and edit all workflows, credentials, and projects. However, there is no way to see who created a particular workflow, so there is a risk of overriding other people's work if you build and edit workflows as an owner.
