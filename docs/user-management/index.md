# User management

User management in n8n allows you to invite people to work in your n8n instance. It includes:

* Login and password management
* Adding and removing users
* Two account types: owner and member

!!! note "Privacy"
    The user management feature doesn't send personal information, such as email or username, to n8n.

## Setup guides

This section contains most usage information for user management, and the [Cloud setup guide](/user-management/cloud-setup/). If you self-host n8n, there are extra steps to configure your n8n instance. Refer to the [Self-hosted guide](/hosting/user-management-self-hosted/).

This section includes guides to configuring [LDAP](/user-management/ldap/) and [SAML](/user-management/saml/) in n8n.
