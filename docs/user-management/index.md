# User management

User management in n8n allows you to invite people to work in your n8n instance. It includes:

* Login and password management
* Adding and removing users
* Three [account types](/user-management/account-types.md): **Owner** and **Member** (and **Admin** for Pro & Enterprise plans)

/// note | Privacy
The user management feature doesn't send personal information, such as email or username, to n8n.
