# User management

/// note | Privacy
The user management feature doesn't send personal information, such as email or username, to n8n.
///

User management in n8n allows you to invite people to work in your n8n instance. It includes:

* Login and password management
* Adding and removing users
* Three [account types](/user-management/account-types.md): **Owner** and **Member** (and **Admin** for Pro & Enterprise plans)

/// info | Single sign-on and LDAP availability
n8n offers [single sign-on (SSO)](/user-management/sso/index.md) and [LDAP](/user-management/ldap.md) user management for enterprise plans.
