# Role-based access control (RBAC)

/// info | Feature availability
RBAC is available on all plans except the Community edition. Different plans have different numbers of projects and roles. Refer to n8n's [pricing page](https://n8n.io/pricing/) for plan details.
///

/// note | Role types and account types
Role types and [account types](/user-management/account-types.md) are different things. Every account has one type. The account can have different role types for different [projects](/user-management/rbac/projects.md).
///

RBAC is a way of managing access to workflows and [credentials](/glossary.md#credential-n8n) based on user roles and projects. You group workflows into projects, and user access depends on the user's project role. This section provides guidance on using RBAC in n8n.
