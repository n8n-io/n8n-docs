# Manage users with SAML

There are some user management tasks that are affected by SAML.

## Exempt users from SAML

You can allow users to log in without using SAML. To do this:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Users**.
2. Select the menu icon by the user you want to exempt from SAML.
3. Select **Allow Manual Login**.

## Deleting users

If you remove a user from your IdP, they remain logged in to n8n. You need to manually remove them from n8n as well. Refer to [Manage users](/user-management/manage-users.md) for guidance on deleting users.
