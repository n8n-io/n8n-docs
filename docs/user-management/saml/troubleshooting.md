# Troubleshooting SAML SSO

If you get an error when testing your SAML setup, check the following:

* Does the app you created in your IdP support SAML?
* Did you enter the n8n redirect URL and entity ID in the correct fields in your IdP?
* Is the metadata XML correct? Check that the metadata you copied into n8n is formatted correctly.

For more support, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/), or contact your support representative if you have a paid support plan.
