# Overview


Data represents units of information that are collected by and transmitted through nodes. For "basic usage" it is not necessarily needed to understand how the data that gets passed from one node to another is structured. However, it becomes important if you want to:

 - Create your own node
 - Write custom expressions
 - Use the Function or Function Item node

This section covers:

* [Transforming data](/workflow//data/transforming-data/)
