## What is Workflow²?

DOC² Workflow helps you to connect any app with an API with any other, and manipulate its data with little or no code. Workflow² is:

    Customizable: highly flexible workflows and the option to build custom nodes.
    Convenient: use our Desktop app or npm to try out n8n, and our Cloud hosting option if you want us to handle the infrastructure.
    Privacy-focused: self-host n8n for maximum privacy and security.



## Where to start
## Up and running

Jump right in to building workflows with the Quickstart guide, or see the hosting section to learn about the options to get started with n8n.
