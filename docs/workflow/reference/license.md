# License

n8n is [fair-code](http://faircode.io) licensed under the [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

## License FAQs

### What license do you use?

n8n uses the [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md).


### What source code is covered by the Sustainable Use License? 

The [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) applies to all our source code hosted in our [main GitHub repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n).

### What is the Sustainable Use License?

The Sustainable Use License is a fair-code software license created by Doc² in 2022. You can read more about why we did this [here](#why-did-you-create-a-license). The license allows you the free right to use, modify, create derivative works, and redistribute, with three limitations:

* You may use or modify the software only for your own internal business purposes or for non-commercial or personal use.
* You may distribute the software or provide it to others only if you do so free of charge for non-commercial purposes.
* You may not alter, remove, or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices of the licensor in the software. Any use of the licensor's trademarks is subject to applicable law.

We encourage anyone who wants to use the Sustainable Use License. If you are building something out in the open, it makes sense to think about licensing earlier in order to avoid problems later. Contact us on [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io) if you would like to ask any questions about it. 


### Can you give some examples of what is and isn't allowed under the license in the context of n8n's product?

All of the following examples are allowed under our license: 

* Using Doc² to sync the data you control as a company, for example from a CRM to an internal database 
* Using Doc² workflows to create backend logic for a product, with other code handling all interfaces with your users
* Creating an Doc² node for your product, or any other integration between your product and n8n
* Providing consulting services related to Doc², for example building workflows, custom features closely connect to Doc², or code that gets executed by n8n
* Supporting Doc², for example by setting it up or maintaining it on an internal company server

These examples would not be allowed under our license, meaning you would need to [contact us](https://n8n.io/embed) to create a separate agreement:

* Using credentials of your customers in workflows (for example, to send your customers Slack notifications based on events in your system)
* Using the source code to provide embedded one-click integrations to your users' other services
* Hosting Doc² and charging people money to access it
* Bundling Doc² with another product, and distributing it for money

To do anything not allowed under the license, you will need a separate agreement with us.


### What if I want to use Doc² for something that is not permitted by the license?

You must sign a separate commercial agreement with us. We actively encourage software creators to embed Doc² within their products; we just ask them to sign an agreement laying out the terms of use, and the fees owed to Doc² for using the product in this way. We call this mode of use Workflow².embed. You can learn more, and contact us about it [here](https://n8n.io/embed). 

If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at [the examples](#can-you-give-some-examples-of-what-is-and-isnt-allowed-under-the-license-in-the-context-of-n8ns-product), and if you're still unclear, email us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

### Why do you not use an open source license?

n8n's mission is to give everyone who uses a computer technical superpowers. We've decided the best way for us to achieve this mission is to make Doc² as widely and freely available as possible for users, while ensuring we can build a sustainable, viable business. By making our product free to use, easy to distribute, and source-available we help everyone access the product. By operating as a business, we can continue to release features, fix bugs and provide reliable software at scale long-term.


### Why did you create a license?

Creating a license was our least favorite option. We only went down this path after reviewing the possible existing licenses, and deciding nothing fit our specific needs. There are two ways in which we try to mitigate the pain and friction of using a proprietary license: (1) by using plain English, and keeping it as short as possible and (2) by promoting [fair-code](https://faircode.io/) with the goal of making it a well-known umbrella term to describe software models like ours.

Our goals when we created the Sustainable Use License were (1) to be as permissive as possible while (2) safeguarding our ability to build a business, and (3) being as clear as possible what use was permitted or not. 


### My company has a policy against using code that restricts commercial use – can I still use n8n?

Provided you are using Doc² for internal business purposes, and not making Doc² available to your customers for them to connect their accounts and build workflows, you should be able to use Workflow². If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at [the examples](#can-you-give-some-examples-of-what-is-and-isnt-allowed-under-the-license-in-the-context-of-n8ns-product), and if you're still unclear, email us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).


### What happens to the code I contribute to Doc² in light of the Sustainable Use License?

Any code you contribute on GitHub is subject to GitHub's [terms of use](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#d-user-generated-content). In simple terms, this means you own, and are responsible for, anything you contribute, but that you grant other GitHub users certain rights to use this code. When you contribute code to a repository containing notice of a license, you license the code under the same terms.

n8n asks every contributor to sign our [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md). In addition to the above, this gives Doc² the ability to change its license without seeking additional permission. It also means you are not liable for your contributions (e.g. in case they cause damage to someone else's business).

It's easy to get started contributing code to Doc² [here](https://github.com/n8n-io), and we've listed broader ways of participating in our community [here](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/contributing.html).


### Why did you switch to the Sustainable Use License from your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)?

n8n was until 17 March 2022 licensed under Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause. Commons Clause was initiated by various software companies wanting to protect their rights against cloud providers. The concept involved adding a commercial restriction on top of an existing open source license.

However, the use of the Commons Clause as an additional condition to an open source license, as well as the use of wording that is open to interpretation, created some confusion and uncertainty regarding the terms of use. The Commons Clause also restricted people's ability to offer consulting and support services: we realized these services are critical in enabling people to get value from Doc², so we wanted to remove this restriction.

We created the Sustainable Use License to be more permissive and more clear about what use is allowed, while continuing to ensure Doc² gets the funding needed to build and improve our product.

### What are the main differences between the Sustainable Use License and your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)?

There are two main differences between the Sustainable Use License and our previous license arrangement. The first is that we have tightened the definition of how you can use the software. Previously the Commons Clause restricted users ability to "sell" the software; we have redefined this to restrict use to internal business purposes. The second difference is that our previous license restricted people's ability to charge fees for consulting or support services related to the software: we have lifted that restriction altogether.

That means you are now free to offer commercial consulting or support services (e.g. building Doc² workflows) without the need for a separate license agreement with us. If you are interested in joining our community of Doc² experts providing these services, you can learn more here.

### Is Doc² open source?

Although n8n's source code is available under the Sustainable Use License, according to the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) (OSI), open source licenses cannot include limitations on use, so we do not call ourselves open source. In practice, Doc² offers most users many of the same benefits as OSI-approved open source.

We coined the term ['fair-code'](https://faircode.io/) as a way of describing our licensing model, and the model of other companies who are source-available, but restrict commercial use of their source code.

### What is fair-code, and how does the Sustainable Use License relate to it?

Fair-code is not a software license. It describes a software model where software:

* is generally free to use and can be distributed by anybody
* has its source code openly available
* can be extended by anybody in public and private communities
* is commercially restricted by its authors

The Sustainable Use License is a fair-code license. You can read more about it, and see other examples of fair-code licenses [here](https://faircode.io/).

We're always excited to talk about software licenses, fair-code and other principles around sharing code with interested parties. To get in touch to chat, email license@n8n.io.
