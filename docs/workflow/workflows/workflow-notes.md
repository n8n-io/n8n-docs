# Workflow notes

Workflow notes allow you to annotate and comment on your workflows.

We encourage using workflow notes heavily, especially on template workflows, to help other users understand your workflow.

## Create a note

Workflow² notes are a type of core node. To add a new note:

1. Open the nodes panel.
2. Search for `note`.
3. Click the **Note** node. Doc² adds a new note to the canvas.

## Edit a note

1. Double click the note you want to edit.
2. Write your note. [This guide](https://commonmark.org/help/) explains how to format your text with Markdown. Doc² uses [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it), which implements the CommonMark specification. 
3. Click away from the note, or press `Esc`, to stop editing.

## Note positioning

You can:

* Drag a note anywhere on the canvas.
* Drag notes behind nodes. You can use this to visually group nodes.
* Resize notes by hovering over the edge of the note and dragging to resize.
