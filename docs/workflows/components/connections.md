# Connections

A connection establishes a link between nodes to route data through the workflow. A connection between two nodes passes data from one node's output to another node's input.

![Example of creating and deleting a connection](/_images/workflows/components/connections/example.gif)

## Create a connection

To create a connection between two nodes, select the grey dot or **Add node** <span class="inline-image">![Add node icon](/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png){.off-glb}</span> on the right side of a node and slide the arrow to the grey rectangle on the left side of the following node.

## Delete a connection

Hover over the connection, then select **Delete** <span class="inline-image">![Delete connector icon](/_images/common-icons/delete-connector.png){.off-glb}</span>.
