# Log panel 

The **Log panel** (also called the *Logs tab*) appears when you run a workflow.  
It shows detailed information about each workflow execution, including:

- Execution status (success, error, stopped)  
- Node-by-node logs  
- Error messages and stack traces (if any)  
- Execution time and duration  
- Links to retry or inspect executions  

The Log panel helps you debug workflows by showing exactly what happened during the run.
