# Export and import workflows

n8n saves workflows in JSON format. You can export your workflows as JSON files or import JSON files into your n8n library. 

You can export a workflow as a JSON file in two ways:

  * **Download**: Select **Workflow menu** <span class="inline-image">![Workflow menu icon](/_images/common-icons/three-dots-horizontal.png)</span> > **Download**. This will download the workflow as a JSON file.
  * **Copy-Paste**: Select all the workflow nodes in the Editor UI, copy them (`Ctrl + c` or `cmd +c`), then paste them (`Ctrl + v` or `cmd + v`) in your desired file.  
  
  To select all nodes, or a group of nodes, click and drag:

You can import JSON files as workflows by copying the JSON workflow to the clipboard (`Ctrl + c` or `cmd +c`) and paste it (`Ctrl + v` or `cmd + v`) into the Editor UI.
