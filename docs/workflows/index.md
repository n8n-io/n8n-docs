# Workflows

A [workflow](/glossary.md#workflow-n8n) is a collection of nodes connected together to automate a process.


* [Create](/workflows/create.md) a workflow.
* Use [Workflow templates](/workflows/templates.md) to help you get started.
* Learn about the key [components](/workflows/components/index.md) of an automation in n8n.
* Debug using the [Executions](/workflows/executions/index.md) list.
* [Share](/workflows/sharing.md) workflows between users.

If it's your first time building a workflow, you may want to use the [quickstart guides](/try-it-out/index.md) to quickly try out n8n features.
