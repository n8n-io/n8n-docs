# Workflow settings

You can customize workflow behavior for individual workflows using workflow settings.

To open the settings:

1. Open your workflow.
2. Select the **Options** <span class="inline-image">![Options menu](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png){.off-glb}</span> menu.
3. Select **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.


The following settings are available:

* **Execution order**: choose the execution order for multi-branch workflows. **v0 (legacy)** executes the first node of each branch, then the second node of each branch, and so on. **v1 (recommended)** executes each branch in turn, completing one branch before starting another. n8n orders the branches based on their position on the [canvas](/glossary.md#canvas-n8n), from topmost to bottommost. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost branch executes first.
* **Error Workflow**: select a workflow to trigger if the current workflow fails. See [Error workflows](/flow-logic/error-handling.md) for more details.
* **This workflow can be called by**: choose whether other workflow can call this workflow.
* **Timezone**: sets the timezone for the workflow to use. The default timezone is EDT (New York). The timezone setting is  important for the Schedule Trigger node.
* **Save failed production executions**: whether n8n should save failed executions for active workflows.
* **Save successful production executions**: whether n8n should save successful executions for active workflows.
* **Save manual executions**: whether n8n should save executions for workflows started by the user in the editor.
* **Save execution progress**: whether n8n should save execution data for each node. If set to **Save**, the workflow resumes from where it stopped in case of an error. This might increase latency.
* **Timeout Workflow**: toggle to enable setting a duration after which n8n should cancel the current workflow execution.
	* **Timeout After**: Set the time in hours, minutes, and seconds after which the workflow should timeout. For n8n Cloud users n8n enforces a maximum available timeout for each plan.
