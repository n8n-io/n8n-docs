# Workflow templates

When creating a new workflow, you can choose whether to start with an empty workflow, or use an existing [template](/glossary.md#template-n8n).

Templates provide:

* Help getting started: n8n might already have a template that does what you need.
* Examples of what you can build
* Best practices for creating your own workflows

## Access templates

Select <span class="n8n-inline-image">![View templates icon](/_images/common-icons/templates.png){.off-glb}</span> **Templates** to view the templates library.

If you use n8n's template library, this takes you to browse [Workflows on the n8n website](https://n8n.io/workflows/). If you use a custom library provided by your organization, you'll be able to search and browse the templates within the app.
