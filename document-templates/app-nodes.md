# How to use this template

1. Make a new branch. If working on an internal ticket, include it at the start of the name. For example, DOC-123-feature-summary.
2. Create a new file, or find the file you want to edit, in integrations/builtin/app-nodes/. If creating a new file, pay attention to the naming conventions: it should match the node name in the codex file. For example, in the Active Campaign node, the codex file (https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/ActiveCampaign/ActiveCampaign.node.json) reads: `"node": "n8n-nodes-base.activeCampaign"`. So the app node file name is n8n-nodes-base.activeCampaign.
3. Copy the template into the file (don't copy this comment).
4. Placeholder text is in _italic_ or between <>. Make sure to replace it! 
5. Before publishing, delete any comments.

Use the style guide: https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/wiki

When you add this node to nav.yml in the navigation, prepend it with the `_Name_:` only, for example ActiveCampaign: _relativepath_

# _Name_ node

<!-- Briefly summarize the node. For example:

Use the _Name_ node to automate work in _Name_ and integrate _Name_ with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of _Name_ features, which includes creating, updating, and deleting events, people, tags, and signatures. -->

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the _Name_ node supports, and links to more resources.
