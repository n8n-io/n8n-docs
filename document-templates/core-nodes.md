# How to use this template

1. Make a new branch. If working on an internal ticket, include it at the start of the name. For example, DOC-123-feature-summary.
2. Create a new file, or find the file you want to edit, in integrations/builtin/core-nodes/. If creating a new file, pay attention to the naming conventions: it should match the node name in the codex file. 
3. Copy the template into the file (don't copy this comment).
4. Placeholder text is in _italic_ or between <>. Make sure to replace it! 
5. Before publishing, delete any comments.

Use the style guide: https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/wiki
You can find more info on working with the docs project in the README: https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/main/README.md

The title should be the name of the node. Add "Trigger" if it's a core trigger node. For example:
Item Lists
Local File Trigger
When you add this node to nav.yml in the navigation, prepend it with the `_Name_:` only, for example ActiveCampaign: _relativepath_

if the node is small enough for a single page, add the sentence below. Create a subheading below this for each error, quirk, pain point, or other complex topic that might trip people up
-->
Here are some common errors and issues with the _Name_ node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
<!-- 
If the node is large enough to warrant subpages, create a separate Common issues page using the common-issues.md template and link to it here using this text:
