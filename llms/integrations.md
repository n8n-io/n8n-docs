# Airtable node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Airtable node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials

This error displays when trying to perform actions not permitted by your current level of access. The full text looks something like this:

```
There was a problem loading the parameter options from server: "Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials?"
```

The error most often displays when the credential you're using doesn't have the scopes it requires on the resources you're attempting to manage.

Refer to the [Airtable credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable.md) and [Airtables scopes documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/scopes) for more information.

## Service is receiving too many requests from you

Airtable has a hard API limit on the number of requests generated using personal access tokens.

If you send more than five requests per second per base, you will receive a 429 error, indicating that you have sent too many requests. You will have to wait 30 seconds before resuming requests. This same limit applies for sending more than 50 requests across all bases per access token.

You can find out more in the [Airtable's rate limits documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/rate-limits). If you find yourself running into rate limits with the Airtable node, consider implementing one of the suggestions on the [handling rate limits](/integrations/builtin/rate-limits.md) page.

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/operation-not-supported.md"


## Node reference

### Get the Record ID

To fetch data for a particular record, you need the Record ID. There are two ways to get the Record ID.

### Create a Record ID column in Airtable

To create a `Record ID` column in your table, refer to this [article](https://support.airtable.com/docs/finding-airtable-ids){:target=_blank .external-link}. You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.

### Use the List operation

To get the Record ID of your record, you can use the **List** operation of the Airtable node. This operation will return the Record ID along with the fields. You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.

### Filter records when using the List operation

To filter records from your Airtable base, use the **Filter By Formula** option. For example, if you want to return all the users that belong to the organization `n8n`, follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Select 'List' from the **Operation** dropdown list.
2. Enter the base ID and the table name in the **Base ID** and **Table** field, respectively.
3. Click on **Add Option** and select 'Filter By Formula' from the dropdown list.
4. Enter the following formula in the **Filter By Formula** field: `{Organization}='n8n'`.

Similarly, if you want to return all the users that don't belong to the organization `n8n`, use the following formula: `NOT({Organization}='n8n')`.

Refer to the Airtable [documentation](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/203255215-Formula-Field-Reference){:target=_balnk .external-link} to learn more about the formulas.

## Common issues

# Discord node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Discord node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Add extra fields to embeds

Discord messages can optionally include embeds, a rich preview component that can include a title, description, image, link, and more.

The Discord node supports embeds when using the **Send** operation on the **Message** resource. Select **Add Embeds** to set extra fields including Description, Author, Title, URL, and URL Image.

To add fields that aren't included by default, set **Input Method** to **Raw JSON**. From here, add a JSON object to the **Value** parameter defining the [field names](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/message#embed-object) and values you want to include.

For example, to include `footer` and `fields`, neither of which are available using the **Enter Fields** Input Method, you could use a JSON object like this:

```json
{
    "author": "My Name",
	"url": "https://discord.js.org",
	"fields": [
		{
			"name": "Regular field title",
			"value": "Some value here"
		}
	],
	"footer": {
		"text": "Some footer text here",
		"icon_url": "https://i.imgur.com/AfFp7pu.png"
	}
}
```

You can learn more about embeds in [Using Webhooks and Embeds | Discord](https://discord.com/safety/using-webhooks-and-embeds).

If you experience issues when working with embeds with the Discord node, you can use the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) with your existing Discord credentials to `POST` to the following URL:

```
https://discord.com/api/v10/channels/<CHANNEL_ID>/messages
```

In the body, include your embed information in the message content like this:

```json
{
	"content": "Test",
	"embeds": [
		{
			"author": "My Name",
			"url": "https://discord.js.org",
			"fields": [
				{
					"name": "Regular field title",
					"value": "Some value here"
				}
			],
			"footer": {
				"text": "Some footer text here",
				"icon_url": "https://i.imgur.com/AfFp7pu.png"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

## Mention users and channels

To mention users and channels in Discord messages, you need to format your message according to [Discord's message formatting guidelines](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#message-formatting).

To mention a user, you need to know the Discord user's user ID. Keep in mind that the user ID is different from the user's display name. Similarly, you need a channel ID to link to a specific channel.

You can learn how to enable developer mode and copy the user or channel IDs in [Discord's documentation on finding User/Server/Message IDs](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID).

Once you have the user or channel ID, you can format your message with the following syntax:

* **User**: `<@USER_ID>`
* **Channel**: `<#CHANNEL_ID>`
* **Role**: `<@&ROLE_ID>`

# Gmail node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Gmail node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages

If you're using the node to [send a message](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/message-operations.md#send-a-message) or [reply to a message](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/message-operations.md#reply-to-a-message), the node appends this statement to the end of the email:

> This email was sent automatically with n8n

To remove this attribution:

1. In the node's **Options** section, select **Add option**.
2. Select **Append n8n attribution**.
3. Turn the toggle off.

Refer to [Send options](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/message-operations.md#send-options) and [Reply options](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/message-operations.md#reply-options) for more information.

## Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials

This error displays next to certain dropdowns in the node, like the **Label Names or IDs** dropdown. The full text looks something like this:

```
There was a problem loading the parameter options from server: "Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials?"

# Google Drive node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Google Drive node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googledrive/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Google hasn't verified this app

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/unverified-app.md"

## Google Cloud app becoming unauthorized

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/app-becoming-unauthorized.md"

## Google Drive OAuth error

If using the OAuth authentication method, you may see an error indicating that you can't sign in because the app doesn't meet Google's expectations for keeping apps secure.

Most often, the actual cause of this issue is that the URLs don't match between Google's OAuth configuration and n8n. To avoid this, start by reviewing any links included in Google's error message. This will contain details about the exact error that occurred.

If you are self-hostin n8n, check the n8n configuration items used to construct external URLs. Verify that the [`N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL`](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment.md) and [`WEBHOOK_URL`](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url.md) environment variables use fully qualified domains.

## Get recent files from Google Drive

To retrieve recent files from Google Drive, you need to sort files by modification time. To do this, you need to search for existing files and retrieve their modification times. Next you can sort the files to find the most recent file and use another Google Drive node target the file by ID.

The process looks like this:

1. Add a **Google Drive** node to your canvas.
2. Select the **File/Folder** resource and the **Search** operation.
3. Enable **Return All** to sort through all files.
4. Set the **What to Search** filter to **Files**.
5. In the **Options**, set the **Fields** to **All**.
6. Connect a **Sort** node to the output of the **Google Drive** node.
7. Choose **Simple** sort type.
8. Enter `modifiedTime` as the **Field Name** in the **Fields To Sort By** section.
9. Choose **Descending** sort order.
10. Add a **Limit** node to the output of the **Sort** node.
11. Set **Max Items** to **1** to keep the most recent file.
12. Connect another **Google Drive** node to the output of the **Limit** node.
13. Select **File** as the **Resource** and the operation of your choice.
14. In the **File** selection, choose **By ID**.
15. Select **Expression** and enter `{{ $json.id }}` as the expression.

# Google Sheets node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Google Sheets node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Append an array

To insert an array of data into Google Sheets, you must convert the array into a valid JSON (key, value) format.

To do so, consider using:

1. The [Split Out](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout.md) node.
1. The [AI Transform](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aitransform.md) node. For example, try entering something like:
    ```
    Convert 'languages' array to JSON (key, value) pairs.
    ```
1. The [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/index.md).

- **When Filter Has Multiple Matches**: Set to **Return All Matches** to get multiple matches. By default only the first result gets returned. 

/// note | First row
n8n treats the first row in a Google Sheet as a heading row, and doesn't return it when reading all rows. If you want to read the first row, use the **Options** to set **Data Location on Sheet**.

## Get the Row ID

To update or delete a particular record, you need the Row ID. There are two ways to get the Row ID:

**Create a Row ID column in Grist**

Create a new column in your Grist table with the formula `$id`.

**Use the Get All operation**

The **Get All** operation returns the Row ID of each record along with the fields.
 
You can get it with the expression `{{$node["GristNodeName"].json["id"]}}`.


## Filter records when using the Get All operation

- Select **Add Option** and select **Filter** from the dropdown list.
- You can add filters for any number of columns. The result will only include records which match all the columns.
- For each column, you can enter any number of values separated by commas. The result will include records which match any of the values for that column.

## Fetch issues for a specific project

The **Get All** operation returns all the issues from Jira. To fetch issues for a particular project, you need to use Jira Query Language (JQL).

For example, if you want to receive all the issues of a project named `n8n`, you'd do something like this:

- Select **Get All** from the **Operation** dropdown list.
- Toggle **Return All** to true.
- Select **Add Option** and select **JQL**.
- Enter `project=n8n` in the **JQL** field.

This query will fetch all the issues in the project named `n8n`. Enter the name of your project instead of `n8n` to fetch all the issues for your project.

## Options

### Query Options

The Query Submission operation supports query options:

* In the main section of the **Parameters** panel:
    * **Start** controls the index offset to start the query from (to use the API pagination logic).
    * **Limit** sets the maximum number of records to return. Note that the API always has a limit of 30,000 returned records, whatever value you provide.
* In the **Query Options** section, you can activate the following parameters:
    * **Query** lets you specify filter predicates in MongoDB's JSON query format. For example: `{"status": "success", "_submission_time": {"$lt": "2021-11-01T01:02:03"}}` queries for all submissions with the value `success` for the field `status`, and submitted before November 1st, 2021, 01:02:03.
    * **Fields** lets you specify the list of fields you want to fetch, to make the response lighter.
    * **Sort** lets you provide a list of sorting criteria in MongoDB JSON format. For example, `{"status": 1, "_submission_time": -1}` specifies a sort order by ascending status, and then descending submission time.

More details about these options can be found in the [Formhub API docs](https://github.com/SEL-Columbia/formhub/wiki/Formhub-Access-Points-(API)#api-parameters)

### Submission options

All operations that return form submission data offer options to tweak the response. These include:

- Download options lets you download any attachment linked to each particular form submissions, such as pictures and videos. It also lets you select the naming pattern, and the file size to download (if available - typically for images). 
- Formatting options perform some reformatting as described in [About reformatting](#about-reformatting).

#### About reformatting

The default JSON format for KoboToolbox submission data is sometimes hard to deal with, because it's not schema-aware, and all fields are therefore returned as strings.

This node provides a lightweight opinionated reformatting logic, enabled with the **Reformat?** parameter, available on all operations that return form submissions: the submission query, get, and the attachment download operations.

When enabled, the reformatting:

- Reorganizes the JSON into a multi-level hierarchy following the form's groups. By default, question grouping hierarchy is materialized by a `/` character in the field names, for example `Group1/Question1`. With reformatting enabled, n8n reorganizes these into `Group1.Question1`, as nested JSON objects.
- Renames fields to trim `_` (not supported by many downstream systems).
- Parses all geospatial fields (Point, Line, and Area question types) into their standard GeoJSON equivalent.
- Splits all fields matching any of the **Multiselect Mask** wildcard masks into an array. Since the multi-select fields appear as space-separated strings, they can't be guessed algorithmically, so you must provide a field naming mask. Format the masks as a comma-separated list. Lists support the `*` wildcard.
- Converts all fields matching any of the **Number Mask** wildcard masks into a JSON float.

Here's a detailed example in JSON:

```json
{
  "_id": 471987,
  "formhub/uuid": "189436bb09a54957bfcc798e338b54d6",

}
```

With reformatting enabled, and the appropriate masks for multi-select and number formatting (for example, `Crops_*` and `*_sqm` respectively), n8n parses it into:

## Common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the Microsoft Entra ID node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Updating the Allow External Senders and Auto Subscribe New Members options fails

You can't update the **Allow External Senders** and **Auto Subscribe New Members** options directly after creating a new group. You must wait after creating a group before you can change the values of these options.

When designing workflows that use multiple Microsoft Entra ID nodes to first create groups and then update these options, add a [Wait](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait.md) node between the two operations. A Wait node configured to pause for at least two seconds allows time for the group to fully initialize. After the wait, the update operation can complete without erroring.

## Find the folder ID

To perform operations on folders, you need to supply the ID. You can find this:

* In the URL of the folder
* By searching for it using the node. You need to do this if using MS 365 (where OneDrive uses SharePoint behind the scenes):
	1. Select **Resource** > **Folder**.
	2. Select **Operation** > **Search**.
	3. In **Query**, enter the folder name.
	4. Select **Execute step**. n8n runs the query and returns data about the folder, including an `id` field containing the folder ID.

# MySQL node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [MySQL node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mysql/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Update rows by composite key

The MySQL node's **Update** operation lets you to update rows in a table by providing a **Column to Match On** and a value. This works for tables where single column values can uniquely identify individual rows.

You can't use this pattern for tables that use [composite keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_key), where you need multiple columns to uniquely identify a row. A example of this is MySQL's [`user` table](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysql-user-table/) in the `mysql` database, where you need both the `user` and `host` columns to uniquely identify rows.

To update tables with composite keys, write the query manually with the **Execute SQL** operation instead. There, you can match on multiple values, like in this example which matches on both `customer_id` and `product_id`: 

```sql
UPDATE orders SET quantity = 3 WHERE customer_id = 538 AND product_id = 800;
```

## Can't connect to a local MySQL server when using Docker

When you run either n8n or MySQL in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to MySQL.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only MySQL is in Docker

If only MySQL is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When running the container, [publish the port](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/) with the `-p` flag. By default, MySQL runs on port 3306, so your Docker command should look like this:

```shell
docker run -p 3306:3306 --name my-mysql -d mysql:latest
```

When configuring [MySQL credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mysql.md), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **Host** to `localhost`).

### If only n8n is in Docker

If only n8n is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` on the host.

If you are running n8n in Docker on **Linux**, use the `--add-host` flag to map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` when you start the container. For example:

```shell
docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.

When configuring [MySQL credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mysql.md), use `host.docker.internal` as the **Host** address instead of `localhost`.

### If MySQL and n8n are running in separate Docker containers

If both n8n and MySQL are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way). Add both the MySQL and n8n containers to the same [user-defined bridge network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/bridge/).

When configuring [MySQL credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mysql.md), use the MySQL container's name as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you call the MySQL container `my-mysql`, you would set the **Host** to `my-mysql`.

### If MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container

If MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the `localhost` address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure MySQL to listen on `localhost` and configure the **Host** in the [MySQL credentials in n8n](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama.md) to use `localhost`.

## Decimal numbers returned as strings

By default, the MySQL node returns [`DECIMAL` values](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/fixed-point-types.html) as strings. This is done intentionally to avoid loss of precision that can occur due to limitation with the way JavaScript represents numbers. You can learn more about the decision in the documentation for the [MySQL library](https://sidorares.github.io/node-mysql2/docs/api-and-configurations) that n8n uses.

To output decimal values as numbers instead of strings and ignore the risks in loss of precision, enable the **Output Decimals as Numbers** option. This will output the values as numbers instead of strings.

As an alternative, you can manually	convert from the string to a decimal using the [`toFloat()` function](/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/strings.md#string-toFloat) with [`toFixed()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed) or with the [Edit Fields (Set) node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set.md) after the MySQL node. Be aware that you may still need to account for a potential loss of precision.

## Related resources

Refer to [MySQL's Connectors and APIs documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-connectors.html){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

Refer to MySQL's [SELECT statement documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/select.html){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on writing SQL queries.

## Use query parameters

When creating a query to run on a MySQL database, you can use the **Query Parameters** field in the **Options** section to load data into the query. n8n sanitizes data in query parameters, which prevents SQL injection.

For example, you want to find a person by their email address. Given the following input data:

```js
[
    {
        "email": "alex@example.com",
        "name": "Alex",
        "age": 21 
    },
    {
        "email": "jamie@example.com",
        "name": "Jamie",
        "age": 33 
    }
]
```

You can write a query like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM $1:name WHERE email = $2;
```

Then in **Query Parameters**, provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the email address from each input item in turn:

```js
// users is an example table name
users, {{ $json.email }} 
```

# Notion node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Notion node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.notion/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Relation property not displaying

The Notion node only supports displaying the data relation property for [two-way relations](https://www.notion.com/help/relations-and-rollups). When you connect two Notion databases with a two-way relationship, you can select or filter by the relation property when working with the Notion node's **Database Page** resource.

To enable two-way relations, edit the relation property in Notion and enable the **Show on [name of related database]** option to create a reverse relation. Select a name to use for the relation in the new context. The relation is now accessible in n8n when filtering or selecting.

If you need to work with Notion databases with one-way relationship, you can use the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) with your existing Notion credentials. For example, to update a one-way relationship, you can send a `PATCH` request to the following URL:

```
https://api.notion.com/v1/pages/<page_id>
```

Enable **Send Body**, set the **Body Content Type** to **JSON**, and set **Specify Body** to **Using JSON**.  Afterward, you can enter a JSON object like the following into the **JSON** field:

```json
{
	"properties": {
		"Account": {
			"relation": [
				{
					"id": "<your_relation_ID>"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

## Create toggle heading

The Notion node allows you to create headings and toggles when adding blocks to **Page**, **Database Page**, or **Block** resources. Creating toggleable headings isn't yet supported by the Notion node itself.

You can work around this be creating a regular heading and then modifying it to enable the [`is_toggleable` property](https://developers.notion.com/reference/block#headings):

1. Add a heading with Notion node.
2. Select the resource you want to add a heading to:
	* To add a new page with a heading, select the **Page** or **Database Page** resources with the **Create** operation.
	* To add a heading to an existing page, select the **Block** resource with the **Append After** operation.
3. Select **Add Block** and set the **Type Name or ID** to either **Heading 1**, **Heading 2**, or **Heading 3**.
4. Add an [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) node connected to the Notion node and select the `GET` method.
5. Set the **URL** to `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/<block_ID>`. For example, if your added the heading to an existing page, you could use the following URL: `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{{ $json.results[0].id }}`. If you created a new page instead of appending a block, you may need to discover the block ID by querying the page contents first.
6. Select **Predefined Credential Type** and connect your existing Notion credentials.
7. Add an [Edit Fields (Set)](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set.md) node after the HTTP Request node.
8. Add `heading_1.is_toggleable` as a new **Boolean** field set to `true`. Swap `heading_1` for a different heading number as necessary.
9. Add a second HTTP Request node after the Edit Fields (Set) node.
10. Set the **Method** to `PATCH` and use `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{{ $json.id }}` as the **URL** value.
11. Select **Predefined Credential Type** and connect your existing Notion credentials.
12. Enable **Send Body** and set a parameter.
13. Set the parameter **Name** to `heading_1` (substitute `heading_1` for the heading level you are using).
14. Set the parameter **Value** to `{{ $json.heading_1 }}` (substitute `heading_1` for the heading level you are using).

The above sequence will create a regular heading block. It will query the newly created header, add the `is_toggleable` property, and update the heading block.

## Handle null and empty values

You may receive a validation error when working with the Notion node if you submit fields with empty or null values. This can occur any time you populate fields from previous nodes when that data is missing.

To work around this, check for the existence of the field data before sending it to Notion or use a default value.

To check for the data before executing the Notion node, use an [If](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if.md) node to check whether the field is unset. This allows you to use the [Edit Fields (Set)](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set.md) node to conditionally remove the field when it doesn't have a valid value.

As an alternative, you can set a [default value](/code/cookbook/expressions/check-incoming-data.md) if the incoming data doesn't provide one.

# Postgres node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Postgres node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Dynamically populate SQL `IN` groups with parameters

In Postgres, you can use the SQL [`IN` comparison construct](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-comparisons.html#FUNCTIONS-COMPARISONS-IN-SCALAR) to make comparisons between groups of values:

```sql
SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ('small', 'medium', 'large');
```

While you can use n8n [expressions](/code/expressions.md) in your query to dynamically populate the values in an `IN` group, combining this with [query parameters](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/index.md#use-query-parameters) provides extra protection by automatically sanitizing input.

To construct an `IN` group query with query parameters:

1. Set the **Operation** to **Execute Query**.
2. In **Options**, select **Query Parameters**.
3. Use an expression to select an array from the input data. For example, `{{ $json.input_shirt_sizes }}`.
4. In the **Query** parameter, write your query with the `IN` construct with an empty set of parentheses. For example:
	```sql
	SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ();
	```
5. Inside of the `IN` parentheses, use an expression to dynamically create index-based placeholders (like `$1`, `$2`, and `$3`) for the number of items in your query parameter array. You can do this by increasing each array index by one since the placeholder variables are 1 indexed:
	```sql
	SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ({{ $json.input_shirt_sizes.map((i, pos) => "$" + (pos+1)).join(', ') }});
	```

With this technique, n8n automatically creates the correct number of [prepared statement placeholders](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare.html) for the `IN` values according to the number of items in your array.

## Working with timestamps and time zones

To avoid complications with how n8n and Postgres interpret timestamp and time zone data, follow these general tips:

- **Use UTC when storing and passing dates**: Using UTC helps avoid confusion over timezone conversions when converting dates between different representations and systems.
- **Set the execution timezone**: Set the global timezone in n8n using either [environment variables](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/time-zone.md) (for self-hosted) or in the [settings](/manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone.md) (for n8n Cloud). You can set a workflow-specific timezone in the [workflow settings](/workflows/settings.md).
- **Use ISO 8601 format**: The [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) encodes the day of the month, month, year, hour, minutes, and seconds in a standardized string. n8n passes dates between nodes as strings and uses [Luxon](/code/cookbook/luxon.md) to parse dates. If you need to cast to ISO 8601 explicitly, you can use the [Date & Time node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime.md) and a custom format set to the string `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss`.

## Related resources

n8n provides a trigger node for Postgres. You can find the trigger node docs [here](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgrestrigger.md).

## Use query parameters

When creating a query to run on a Postgres database, you can use the **Query Parameters** field in the **Options** section to load data into the query. n8n sanitizes data in query parameters, which prevents SQL injection.

For example, you want to find a person by their email address. Given the following input data:

```js
[
    {
        "email": "alex@example.com",
        "name": "Alex",
        "age": 21 
    },
    {
        "email": "jamie@example.com",
        "name": "Jamie",
        "age": 33 
    }
]
```

You can write a query like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM $1:name WHERE email = $2;
```

Then in **Query Parameters**, provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the email address from each input item in turn:

```js
// users is an example table name
{{ [ 'users', $json.email ] }} 
```

# Supabase node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Supabase node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.supabase/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Filtering rows by metadata

To filter rows by [Supabase metadata](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/python/metadata), set the **Select Type** to **String**.

From there, you can construct a query in the **Filters (String)** parameter to filter the metadata using the [Supabase metadata query language](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/python/metadata#metadata-query-language), inspired by the [MongoDB selectors](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/) format. Access the metadata properties using the [Postgres `->>` arrow JSON operator](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-PROCESSING) like this (curly brackets denote components to fill in):

```
metadata->>{your-property}={comparison-operator}.{comparison-value}
```

For example to access an `age` property in the metadata and return results greater than or equal to 21, you could enter the following in the **Filters (String)** field:

```
metadata->>age=gte.21
```

You can combine these operators to construct more complex queries.

## Can't connect to a local Supabase database when using Docker

When you run Supabase in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Supabase.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only Supabase is in Docker

If only Supabase is running in Docker, the Docker Compose file used by the [self-hosting guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker) already runs Supabase bound to the correct interfaces.

When configuring [Supabase credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/supabase.md), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **Host** to `localhost`).

### If Supabase and n8n are running in separate Docker containers

If both n8n and Supabase are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure Supabase to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official [Docker compose configuration](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker) already does this this). Add both the Supabase and n8n components to the same [user-defined bridge network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/bridge/) if you aren't already managing them together in the same Docker Compose file.

When configuring [Supabase credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/supabase.md), use the Supabase API gateway container's name (`supabase-kong` by default) as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you use the default configuration, you would set the **Host** to `http://supabase-kong:8000`.

## Records are accessible through Postgres but not Supabase

If queries for records return empty using the Supabase node, but are available through the [Postgres](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/index.md) node or with a Postgres client, there may be a conflict with Supabase's [Row Level Security (RLS)](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security) policy.

Supabase always enables RLS when you create a table in a public schema with the Table Editor. When RLS is active, the API doesn't return any data with the public `anon` key until you create policies. This is a security measure to ensure that you only expose data you intend to.

To access data from a table with RLS enabled as the `anon` role, [create a policy](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security#creating-policies) to enable the access patterns you intend to use.

# Telegram node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Telegram node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Add a bot to a Telegram channel

For a bot to send a message to a channel, you must add the bot to the channel. If you haven't added the bot to the channel, you'll see an error with a description like:
`Error: Forbidden: bot is not a participant of the channel`.

To add a bot to a channel:

1. In the Telegram app, access the target channel and select the channel name.
2. Label the channel name as **public channel**.
3. Select **Administrators** > **Add Admin**.
4. Search for the bot's username and select it.
5. Select the checkmark on the top-right corner to add the bot to the channel.

## Get the Chat ID

You can only use `@channelusername` on public channels. To interact with a Telegram group, you need that group's Chat ID.

There are three ways to get that ID:

1. From the Telegram Trigger: Use the [Telegram Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegramtrigger/index.md) node in your workflow to get a Chat ID. This node can trigger on different events and returns a Chat ID on successful execution.
2. From your web browser: Open Telegram in a web browser and open the group chat. The group's Chat ID is the series of digits behind the letter "g." Prefix your group Chat ID with a `-` when you enter it in n8n.
3. Invite Telegram's [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot){:target=_blank .external-link} to the group: Once you add it, the bot outputs a JSON file that includes a `chat` object. The `id` for that object is the group Chat ID. Then remove the RawDataBot from your group.

## Send more than 30 messages per second

The Telegram API has a [limitation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#broadcasting-to-users){:target=_blank .external-link} of sending only 30 messages per second. Follow these steps to send more than 30 messages:

1. **Loop Over Items node**: Use the [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches.md) node to get at most 30 chat IDs from your database.
2. **Telegram node**: Connect the Telegram node with the Loop Over Items node. Use the **Expression Editor** to select the Chat IDs from the Loop Over Items node.
3. **Code node**: Connect the [Code](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/index.md) node with the Telegram node. Use the Code node to wait for a few seconds before fetching the next batch of chat IDs. Connect this node with the Loop Over Items node.

You can also use this [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/772){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages

If you're using the node to [send Telegram messages](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/message-operations.md#send-message), the message automatically gets an n8n attribution appended to the end:

> This message was sent automatically with n8n

To remove this attribution:

1. In the node's **Additional Fields** section, select **Add Field**.
2. Select **Append n8n attribution**.
3. Turn the toggle off.

Refer to [Send Message additional fields](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/message-operations.md#send-message-additional-fields) for more information.

# WhatsApp Business Cloud node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [WhatsApp Business Cloud node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.whatsapp/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Bad request - please check your parameters

This error occurs when WhatsApp Business Cloud rejects your request because of a problem with its parameters. It's common to see this when using the **Send Template** operation if the data you send doesn't match the format of your template.

To resolve this issue, review the parameters in your [message template](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2055875911147364?id=2129163877102343). Pay attention to each parameter's data type and the order they're defined in the template.

Check the data that n8n is mapping to the template parameters. If you're using expressions to set parameter values, check the input data to make sure each item resolves to a valid value. You may want to use the [Edit Fields (Set) node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set.md) or [set a fallback value](/code/cookbook/expressions/check-incoming-data.md) to ensure you send a value with the correct format.

## Working with non-text media

The WhatsApp Business Cloud node can work with non-text messages and media like images, audio, documents, and more.

If your operation includes a **Input Data Field Name** or **Property Name** parameter, set this to the field name itself rather than referencing the data in an expression.

For example, if you are trying to send a message with an "Image" **MessageType** and **Take Image From** set to "n8n", set **Input Data Field Name** to a field name like `data` instead of an expression like `{{ $json.input.data }}`.

# OpenAI Assistant operations

Use this operation to create, delete, list, message, or update an assistant in OpenAI. Refer to [OpenAI](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/index.md) for more information on the OpenAI node itself.

## Create an Assistant

Use this operation to create a new assistant.

Enter these parameters:

- **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [OpenAI credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai.md).
- **Resource**: Select **Assistant**.
- **Operation**: Select **Create an Assistant**.
- **Model**: Select the model that the assistant will use. If you’re not sure which model to use, try `gpt-4o` if you need high intelligence or `gpt-4o-mini` if you need the fastest speed and lowest cost. Refer to [Models overview | OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information. 
- **Name**: Enter the name of the assistant. The maximum length is 256 characters.
- **Description**: Enter the description of the assistant. The maximum length is 512 characters.
  ```
  A virtual assistant that helps users with daily tasks, including setting reminders, answering general questions, and providing quick information.
  ```
- **Instructions**: Enter the system instructions that the assistant uses. The maximum length is 32,768 characters. Use this to specify the persona used by the model in its replies. 
  ```
  Always respond in a friendly and engaging manner. When a user asks a question, provide a concise answer first, followed by a brief explanation or additional context if necessary. If the question is open-ended, offer a suggestion or ask a clarifying question to guide the conversation. Keep the tone positive and supportive, and avoid technical jargon unless specifically requested by the user.
  ```
- **Code Interpreter**: Turn on to enable the code interpreter for the assistant, where it can write and execute code in a sandbox environment. Enable this tool for tasks that require computations, data analysis, or any logic-based processing.
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Turn on to enable knowledge retrieval for the assistant, allowing it to access external sources or a connected knowledge base. Refer to [File Search | OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information. 
  - **Files**: Select a file to upload for your external knowledge source. Use **Upload a File** operation to add more files. 

### Options

- **Output Randomness (Temperature)**: Adjust the randomness of the response. The range is between `0.0` (deterministic) and `1.0` (maximum randomness). We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Top P)** but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around 0.7) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If they’re too chaotic or off-track, decrease it. Defaults to `1.0`. 
- **Output Randomness (Top P)**: Adjust the Top P setting to control the diversity of the assistant's responses. For example, `0.5` means half of all likelihood-weighted options are considered. We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Temperature)** but not both. Defaults to `1.0`. 
- **Fail if Assistant Already Exists**: If enabled, the operation will fail if an assistant with the same name already exists.

Refer to [Models overview | OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information. 
- **Messages**: Enter a **Text** prompt and assign a **Role** that the model will use to generate responses. Refer to [Prompt engineering | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on how to write a better prompt by using these roles. Choose from one of these roles: 
    - **User**: Sends a message as a user and gets a response from the model. 
    - **Assistant**: Tells the model to adopt a specific tone or personality. 
    - **System**: By default, the system message is `"You are a helpful assistant"`. You can define instructions in the user message, but the instructions set in the system message are more effective. You can only set one system message per conversation. Use this to set the model's behavior or context for the next user message. 
- **Simplify Output**: Turn on to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data. 
- **Output Content as JSON**: Turn on to attempt to return the response in JSON format. Compatible with `GPT-4 Turbo` and all `GPT-3.5 Turbo` models newer than `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

### Options

- **Frequency Penalty**: Apply a penalty to reduce the model's tendency to repeat similar lines. The range is between `0.0` and `2.0`.
- **Maximum Number of Tokens**: Set the maximum number of tokens for the response. One token is roughly four characters for standard English text. Use this to limit the length of the output. 
- **Number of Completions**: Defaults to 1. Set the number of completions you want to generate for each prompt. Use carefully since setting a high number will quickly consume your tokens. 
- **Presence Penalty**: Apply a penalty to influence the model to discuss new topics. The range is between `0.0` and `2.0`.
- **Output Randomness (Temperature)**: Adjust the randomness of the response. The range is between `0.0` (deterministic) and `1.0` (maximum randomness). We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Top P)** but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around `0.7`) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If they’re too chaotic or off-track, decrease it. Defaults to `1.0`. 
- **Output Randomness (Top P)**: Adjust the Top P setting to control the diversity of the assistant's responses. For example, `0.5` means half of all likelihood-weighted options are considered. We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Temperature)** but not both. Defaults to `1.0`. 

Refer to [Message a Model | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/text-completion/create){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information.

## Classify Text for Violations

Use this operation to identify and flag content that might be harmful. OpenAI model will analyze the text and return a response containing:

- `flagged`: A boolean field indicating if the content is potentially harmful.
- `categories`: A list of category-specific violation flags.
- `category_scores`: Scores for each category.

Enter these parameters:

- **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [OpenAI credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai.md).
- **Resource**: Select **Text**.
- **Operation**: Select **Classify Text for Violations**.
- **Text Input**: Enter text to classify if it violates the moderation policy. 
- **Simplify Output**: Turn on to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data.

### Options

- **Use Stable Model**: Turn on to use the stable version of the model instead of the latest version, accuracy may be slightly lower.

Refer to [Moderations | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/moderations){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information.

# AI Agent node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [AI Agent node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Internal error: 400 Invalid value for 'content'

A full error message might look like this:

```
Internal error
Error: 400 Invalid value for 'content': expected a string, got null.
<stack-trace>
```

This error can occur if the **Prompt** input contains a null value.

You might see this in one of two scenarios:

1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and have an expression in your **Text** that isn't generating a value.
    * To resolve, make sure your expressions reference valid fields and that they resolve to valid input rather than null.
2. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node** and the incoming data has null values.
    * To resolve, remove any null values from the `chatInput` field of the input node.

## Error in sub-node Simple Memory

This error displays when n8n runs into an issue with the [Simple Memory](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorybufferwindow/index.md) sub-node.

It most often occurs when your workflow or the workflow template you copied uses an older version of the Simple memory node (previously known as "Window Buffer Memory").

Try removing the Simple Memory node from your workflow and re-adding it, which will guarantee you're using the latest version of the node.

## A Chat Model sub-node must be connected error

This error displays when n8n tries to execute the node without having a Chat Model connected.

To resolve this, click the + Chat Model button at the bottom of your screen when the node is open, or click the Chat Model + connector when the node is closed. n8n will then open a selection of possible Chat Models to pick from.

## No prompt specified error

This error occurs when the agent expects to get the prompt from the previous node automatically. Typically, this happens when you're using the [Chat Trigger Node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/). 

To resolve this issue, find the **Prompt** parameter of the AI Agent node and change it from **Connected Chat Trigger Node** to **Define below**. This allows you to manually build your prompt by referencing output data from other nodes or by adding static text.

# Conversational AI Agent node

The Conversational Agent has human-like conversations. It can maintain context, understand user intent, and provide relevant answers. This agent is typically used for building chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer support systems.

The Conversational Agent describes [tools](/glossary.md#ai-tool) in the system prompt and parses JSON responses for tool calls. If your preferred AI model doesn't support tool calling or you're handling simpler interactions, this agent is a good general option. It's more flexible but may be less accurate than the [Tools Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent.md).

Refer to [AI Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index.md) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

## Node parameters

Configure the Conversational Agent using the following parameters.

### Prompt

### Require Specific Output Format

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/langchain-root-nodes/output-format.md"

## Node options

Refine the Conversational Agent node's behavior using these options:

### Human Message

Tell the agent about the tools it can use and add context to the user's input.

You must include these expressions and variable:

* `{tools}`: A LangChain expression that provides a string of the tools you've connected to the Agent. Provide some context or explanation about who should use the tools and how they should use them.
* `{format_instructions}`: A LangChain expression that provides the schema or format from the output parser node you've connected. Since the instructions themselves are context, you don't need to provide context for this expression.
* `{{input}}`: A LangChain variable containing the user's prompt. This variable populates with the value of the **Prompt** parameter. Provide some context that this is the user's input.

Here's an example of how you might use these strings:

Example:

```
TOOLS
------
Assistant can ask the user to use tools to look up information that may be helpful in answering the user's original question. The tools the human can use are:

{tools}

{format_instructions}

USER'S INPUT
--------------------
Here is the user's input (remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a JSON blob with a single action, and NOTHING else):

{{input}}

# AI Agent node

An [AI agent](/glossary.md#ai-agent) is an autonomous system that receives data, makes rational decisions, and acts within its environment to achieve specific goals. The AI agent's environment is everything the agent can access that isn't the agent itself. This agent uses external [tools](/glossary.md#ai-tool) and APIs to perform actions and retrieve information. It can understand the capabilities of different tools and determine which tool to use depending on the task. 

/// note | Connect a tool
You must connect at least one tool [sub-node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/index.md) to an AI Agent node.
///

/// note | Agent type
Prior to version 1.82.0, the AI Agent had a setting for working as different agent types. This has now been removed and all AI Agent nodes work as a `Tools Agent` which was the recommended and most frequently used setting. If you're working with older versions of the AI Agent in workflows or templates, as long as they were set to 'Tools Agent', they should continue to behave as intended with the updated node.

# Plan and Execute Agent node

The Plan and Execute Agent is like the [ReAct agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/react-agent.md) but with a focus on planning. It first creates a high-level plan to solve the given task and then executes the plan step by step. This agent is most useful for tasks that require a structured approach and careful planning.

Refer to [AI Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index.md) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

# ReAct AI Agent node

The ReAct Agent node implements [ReAct](https://react-lm.github.io/){:target=_blank .external-link} logic. ReAct (reasoning and acting) brings together the reasoning powers of chain-of-thought prompting and action plan generation.

The ReAct Agent reasons about a given task, determines the necessary actions, and then executes them. It follows the cycle of reasoning and acting until it completes the task. The ReAct agent can break down complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks, prioritise them, and execute them one after the other.

Refer to [AI Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index.md) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

/// note | No memory
The ReAct agent doesn't support memory sub-nodes. This means it can't recall previous prompts or simulate an ongoing conversation.
///

## Node parameters

Configure the ReAct Agent using the following parameters.

### Prompt

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/langchain-root-nodes/prompt.md"

### Require Specific Output Format

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/langchain-root-nodes/output-format.md"

## Node options

Use the options to create a message to send to the agent at the start of the conversation. The message type depends on the model you're using:

* **Chat models**: These models have the concept of three components interacting (AI, system, and human). They can receive system messages and human messages (prompts).
* **Instruct models**: These models don't have the concept of separate AI, system, and human components. They receive one body of text, the instruct message.

### Human Message Template

Use this option to extend the user prompt. This is a way for the agent to pass information from one iteration to the next.

Available LangChain expressions:

* `{input}`: Contains the user prompt.
* `{agent_scratchpad}`: Information to remember for the next iteration.

### Prefix Message

Enter text to prefix the tools list at the start of the conversation. You don't need to add the list of tools. LangChain automatically adds the tools list.

### Suffix Message for Chat Model

Add text to append after the tools list at the start of the conversation when the agent uses a chat model. You don't need to add the list of tools. LangChain automatically adds the tools list.

### Suffix Message for Regular Model

Add text to append after the tools list at the start of the conversation when the agent uses a regular/instruct model. You don't need to add the list of tools. LangChain automatically adds the tools list.

### Data Source

Choose the database to use as a data source for the node. Options include:

* **MySQL**: Select this option to use a MySQL database.
    * Also select the **Credential for MySQL**.
* **SQLite**: Select this option to use a SQLite database.
    * You must add a [Read/Write File From Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile.md) node before the Agent to read your SQLite file.
    * Also enter the **Input Binary Field** name of your SQLite file coming from the Read/Write File From Disk node.
* **Postgres**: Select this option to use a Postgres database.
    * Also select the **Credential for Postgres**.

/// warning | Postgres and MySQL Agents
If you are using [Postgres](/integrations/builtin/credentials/postgres.md) or [MySQL](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mysql.md), this agent doesn't support the credential tunnel options.
///

### Prompt

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/langchain-root-nodes/prompt.md"

## Node options

Refine the SQL Agent node's behavior using these options:

### Ignored Tables

If you'd like the node to ignore any tables from the database, enter a comma-separated list of tables you'd like it to ignore.

If left empty, the agent doesn't ignore any tables.

### Include Sample Rows

Enter the number of sample rows to include in the prompt to the agent. Default is `3`.

Sample rows help the agent understand the schema of the database, but they also increase the number of tokens used.

### Included Tables

If you'd only like to include specific tables from the database, enter a comma-separated list of tables to include.

If left empty, the agent includes all tables.

### Prefix Prompt

Enter a message you'd like to send to the agent before the **Prompt** text. This initial message can provide more context and guidance to the agent about what it can and can't do, and how to format the response.

n8n fills this field with an example.

### Suffix Prompt

Enter a message you'd like to send to the agent after the **Prompt** text.

Available LangChain expressions:

* `{chatHistory}`: A history of messages in this conversation, useful for maintaining context.
* `{input}`: Contains the user prompt.
* `{agent_scratchpad}`: Information to remember for the next iteration.

n8n fills this field with an example.

### Limit

Enter the maximum number of results to return.

Default is `10`.

# Tools AI Agent node

The Tools Agent uses external [tools](/glossary.md#ai-tool) and APIs to perform actions and retrieve information. It can understand the capabilities of different tools and determine which tool to use depending on the task. This agent helps integrate LLMs with various external services and databases.

This agent has an enhanced ability to work with tools and can ensure a standard output format.

The Tools Agent implements [Langchain's tool calling](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tool_calling/){:target=_blank .external-link} interface. This interface describes available tools and their schemas. The agent also has improved output parsing capabilities, as it passes the parser to the model as a formatting tool.

Refer to [AI Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index.md) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

# Basic LLM Chain node

Use the Basic LLM Chain node to set the prompt that the model will use along with setting an optional parser for the response.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Basic LLM Chain node and links to more resources.

/// note | Examples and templates
For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Basic LLM Chain integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/basic-llm-chain/){:target=_blank .external-link} page.

### Require Specific Output Format

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/langchain-root-nodes/output-format.md"

## Chat Messages

Use **Chat Messages** when you're using a chat model to set a message.

n8n ignores these options if you don't connect a chat model. Select the **Type Name or ID** you want the node to use:

#### AI

Enter a sample expected response in the **Message** field. The model will try to respond in the same way in its messages.

#### System

Enter a system **Message** to include with the user input to help guide the model in what it should do.

Use this option for things like defining tone, for example: `Always respond talking like a pirate`.

#### User

Enter a sample user input. Using this with the AI option can help improve the output of the agent. Using both together provides a sample of an input and expected response (the **AI Message**) for the model to follow.

Select one of these input types:

* **Text**: Enter a sample user input as a text **Message**.
* **Image (Binary)**: Select a binary input from a previous node. Enter the **Image Data Field Name** to identify which binary field from the previous node contains the image data.
* **Image (URL)**: Use this option to feed an image in from a URL. Enter the **Image URL**.

For both the **Image** types, select the **Image Details** to control how the model processes the image and generates its textual understanding. Choose from:

* **Auto**: The model uses the auto setting, which looks at the image input size and decide if it should use the Low or High setting.
* **Low**: The model receives a low-resolution 512px x 512px version of the image and represents the image with a budget of 65 tokens. This allows the API to return faster responses and consume fewer input tokens. Use this option for use cases that don't require high detail.
* **High**: The model can access the low-resolution image and then creates detailed crops of input images as 512px squares based on the input image size. Each of the detailed crops uses twice the token budget (65 tokens) for a total of 129 tokens. Use this option for use cases that require high detail.

## Common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the Basic LLM Chain node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### No prompt specified error

This error displays when the **Prompt** is empty or invalid.

You might see this error in one of two scenarios:

1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and haven't entered anything in the **Text** field.
    * To resolve, enter a valid prompt in the **Text** field.
2. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node** and the incoming data has no field called `chatInput`. 
    * The node expects the `chatInput` field. If your previous node doesn't have this field, add an [Edit Fields (Set)](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set.md) node to edit an incoming field name to `chatInput`.

# Question and Answer Chain node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Question and Answer Chain node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## No prompt specified error

This error displays when the **Prompt** is empty or invalid.

You might see this in one of two scenarios:

1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and have an expression in your **Text** that isn't generating a value.
    * To resolve, enter a valid prompt in the **Text** field.
    * Make sure any expressions reference valid fields and that they resolve to valid input rather than null.
2. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node** and the incoming data has null values.
    * To resolve, make sure your input contains a `chatInput` field. Add an [Edit Fields (Set)](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set.md) node to edit an incoming field name to `chatInput`.
    * Remove any null values from the `chatInput` field of the input node.

<!-- vale from-write-good.Passive = NO -->
## A Retriever sub-node must be connected error
<!-- vale from-write-good.Passive = YES -->

This error displays when n8n tries to execute the node without having a Retriever connected.

To resolve this, click the + Retriever button at the bottom of your screen when the node is open, or click the Retriever + connector when the node isn't open. n8n will then open a selection of possible Retrievers to pick from.

## Can't produce longer responses

If you need to generate longer responses than the Question and Answer Chain node produces by default, you can try one or more of the following techniques:

* **Connect a more verbose model**: Some AI models produce more terse results than others. Swapping your model for one with a larger context window and more verbose output can increase the word length of your responses.
* **Increase the maximum number of tokens**: Many model nodes (for example the [OpenAI Chat Model](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatopenai/index.md#maximum-number-of-tokens)) include a **Maximum Number of Tokens** option. You can set this to increase the maximum number of tokens the model can use to produce a response.
* **Build larger responses in stages**: For more detailed answers, you may want to construct replies in stages using a variety of AI nodes. You can use AI split up a single question into multiple prompts and create responses for each. You can then compose a final reply by combining the responses again. Though the details are different, you can find a good example of the general idea in this [template for writing a WordPress post with AI](https://n8n.io/workflows/2187-write-a-wordpress-post-with-ai-starting-from-a-few-keywords/).

# LangChain Code node

Use the LangChain Code node to import LangChain. This means if there is functionality you need that n8n hasn't created a node for, you can still use it. By configuring the LangChain Code node connectors you can use it as a normal node, root node or sub-node.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters, guidance on configuring the node, and links to more resources.

/// note | Not available on Cloud
This node is only available on self-hosted n8n.
///

## Node parameters

### Add Code

Add your custom code. Choose either **Execute** or **Supply Data** mode. You can only use one mode.

Unlike the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/index.md), the LangChain Code node doesn't support Python.

* **Execute**: use the LangChain Code node like n8n's own Code node. This takes input data from the workflow, processes it, and returns it as the node output. This mode requires a main input and output. You must create these connections in **Inputs** and **Outputs**.
* **Supply Data**: use the LangChain Code node as a sub-node, sending data to a root node. This uses an output other than main.

By default, you can't load built-in or external modules in this node. Self-hosted users can [enable built-in and external modules](/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods.md).

### Inputs

Choose the input types. 

The main input is the normal connector found in all n8n workflows. If you have a main input and output set in the node, **Execute** code is required.

### Outputs

Choose the output types. 

The main output is the normal connector found in all n8n workflows. If you have a main input and output set in the node, **Execute** code is required.

## Node inputs and outputs configuration

By configuring the LangChain Code node connectors (inputs and outputs) you can use it as an app node, root node or sub-node.

![Screenshot of a workflow with four LangChain nodes, configured as different node types](/_images/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/langchaincode/create-node-types.png)

| Node type | Inputs | Outputs | Code mode |
| --------- | ------ | ------- | --------- |
| App node. Similar to the [Code node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/index.md). | Main | Main | Execute |
| Root node | Main; at least one other type | Main | Execute |
| Sub-node | - | A type other than main. Must match the input type you want to connect to. | Supply Data |
| Sub-node with sub-nodes | A type other than main |A type other than main. Must match the input type you want to connect to. | Supply Data |

## Built-in methods

n8n provides these methods to make it easier to perform common tasks in the LangChain Code node.

# Information Extractor node

Use the Information Extractor node to extract structured information from incoming data.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Information Extractor node,
and links to more resources.

## Node parameters

* **Text** defines the input text to extract information from. This is usually an expression that references a field from the input items. For example, this could be `{{ $json.chatInput }}` if the input is a chat trigger, or `{{ $json.text }}` if a previous node is Extract from PDF.
* Use **Schema Type** to choose how you want to describe the desired output data format. You can choose between:
    * **From Attribute Description**: This option allows you to define the schema by specifying the list of attributes and their descriptions.
    * **Generate From JSON Example**: Input an example JSON object to automatically generate the schema. The node uses the object property types and names. It ignores the actual values.
    * **Define Below**: Manually input the JSON schema. Read the JSON Schema [guides and examples](https://json-schema.org/learn/miscellaneous-examples){:target=_blank .external-link} for help creating a valid JSON schema.

## Node options

* **System Prompt Template**: Use this option to change the system prompt that's used for the information extraction. n8n automatically appends format specification instructions to the prompt.

# Sentiment Analysis node

Use the Sentiment Analysis node to analyze the sentiment of incoming text data.

The language model uses the [**Sentiment Categories**](#node-options) in the node options to determine each item's sentiment.

## Node parameters

* **Text to Analyze** defines the input text for sentiment analysis. This is an expression that references a field from the input items. For example, this could be 
`{{ $json.chatInput }}` if the input is from a chat or message source. By default, it expects a `text` field.

## Node options

* **Sentiment Categories**: Define the categories that you want to classify your input as.
    * By default, these are `Positive, Neutral, Negative`. You can customize these categories to fit your specific use case, such as `Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, Very Negative` for more granular analysis.
* **Include Detailed Results**: When turned on, this option includes sentiment strength and confidence scores in the output. Note that these scores are estimates generated by the language model and are rough indicators rather than precise measurements.
* **System Prompt Template**: Use this option to change the system prompt that's used for the sentiment analysis. It uses the `{categories}` placeholder for the categories.
* **Enable Auto-Fixing**: When enabled, the node automatically fixes model outputs to ensure they match the expected format. Do this by sending the schema parsing error to the LLM and asking it to fix it.

## Usage Notes

### Model Temperature Setting

It's strongly advised to set the temperature of the connected language model to 0 or a value close to 0. This helps ensure that the results are as deterministic as possible, providing more consistent and reliable sentiment analysis across multiple runs.

### Language Considerations

The node's performance may vary depending on the language of the input text.

For best results, ensure your chosen language model supports the input language.

### Processing Large Volumes

When analyzing large amounts of text, consider splitting the input into smaller chunks to optimize processing time and resource usage.

### Iterative Refinement

For complex sentiment analysis tasks, you may need to iteratively refine the system prompt and categories to achieve the desired results.

## Example Usage

### Basic Sentiment Analysis

1. Connect a data source (for example, RSS Feed, HTTP Request) to the Sentiment Analysis node.
2. Set the "Text to Analyze" field to the relevant item property (for example, `{{ $json.content }}` for blog post content).
3. Keep the default sentiment categories.
4. Connect the node's outputs to separate paths for processing positive, neutral, and negative sentiments differently.

### Custom Category Analysis

1. Change the **Sentiment Categories** to `Excited, Happy, Neutral, Disappointed, Angry`.
2. Adjust your workflow to handle these five output categories.
3. Use this setup to analyze customer feedback with more nuanced emotional categories.

# Text Classifier node

Use the Text Classifier node to classify (categorize) incoming data. Using the categories provided in the parameters (see below), each item is passed to the model to determine its category.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Text Classifier node, and links to more resources.

## Node parameters

* **Input Prompt** defines the input to classify. This is usually an expression that references a field from the input items. For example, this could be `{{ $json.chatInput }}` if the input is a chat trigger. By default it references the `text` field.
* **Categories**: Add the categories that you want to classify your input as. Categories have a name and a description. Use the description to tell the model what the category means. This is important if the meaning isn't obvious. You can add as many categories as you like.

## Node options

* **Allow Multiple Classes To Be True**: You can configure the classifier to always output a single class per item (turned off), or allow the model to select multiple classes (turned on).
* **When No Clear Match**: Define what happens if the model can't find a good match for an item. There are two options:
	- **Discard Item** (the default): If the node doesn't detect any of the categories, it drops the item.
	- **Output on Extra, 'Other' Branch**: Creates a separate output branch called **Other**. When the node doesn't detect any of the categories, it outputs items in this branch.
* **System Prompt Template**: Use this option to change the system prompt that's used for the classification. It uses the `{categories}` placeholder for the categories.

* **Enable Auto-Fixing**: When enabled, the node automatically fixes model outputs to ensure they match the expected format. Do this by sending the schema parsing error to the LLM and asking it to fix it.

# Simple Vector Store node

Use the Simple Vector Store node to store and retrieve [embeddings](/glossary.md#ai-embedding) in n8n's in-app memory. 

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Simple Vector Store node, and links to more resources.

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-node-expression-resolution.md"

/// note | This node is different from AI memory nodes
The simple vector storage described here is different to the AI memory nodes such as [Simple Memory](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorybufferwindow/index.md).

This node creates a [vector database](/glossary.md#ai-vector-store) in the app memory.
///


/// warning | For development use only
This node stores data in memory only and isn't recommended for production use. All data is lost when n8n restarts and may also be purged in low-memory conditions.
///

## Node usage patterns

You can use the Simple Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents

You can use the Simple Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the Simple Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of in step 2 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

You can connect the Simple Vector Store node directly to the [tool](/glossary.md#ai-tool) connector of an [AI agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index.md) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Simple Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore.md) node with the Simple Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Simple Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/index.md) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the linked example uses Pinecone, but the pattern is the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Simple Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore.md) to summarize results and answer questions from the Simple Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Simple Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Simple Vector store.

## Memory Management

The Simple Vector Store implements memory management to prevent excessive memory usage:

- Automatically cleans up old vector stores when memory pressure increases
- Removes inactive stores that haven't been accessed for a configurable amount of time
- Each workflow gets its own isolated storage space identified by the workflow ID and memory key

### Configuration Options

You can control memory usage with these environment variables:

 | Variable                      | Type   | Default | Description                                                                         |
 |-------------------------------|--------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | `N8N_VECTOR_STORE_MAX_MEMORY` | Number | -1      | Maximum memory in MB allowed for all vector stores combined (-1 to disable limits). |
 | `N8N_VECTOR_STORE_TTL_HOURS`  | Number | -1      | Hours of inactivity after which a store gets removed (-1 to disable TTL).           |

On n8n Cloud, these values are preset to 100MB (about 8,000 documents, depending on document size and metadata) and 7 days respectively. For self-hosted instances, both values default to -1(no memory limits or time-based cleanup).

# MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node

MongoDB Atlas Vector Search is a feature of MongoDB Atlas that enables users to store and query vector embeddings. Use this node to interact with Vector Search indexes in your MongoDB Atlas collections. You can insert documents, retrieve documents, and use the vector store in chains or as a tool for agents.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node, and links to more resources.

/// note | Credentials
You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mongodb.md).
///

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-node-expression-resolution.md"

## Prerequisites

Before using this node, create a [Vector Search index](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/vector-search-type/) in your MongoDB Atlas collection. Follow these steps to create one:

1. Log in to the [MongoDB Atlas dashboard](https://cloud.mongodb.com/).

3. Select your organization and project.
4. Find "Search & Vector Search" section.
5. Select your cluster and click "Go to search".
7. Click "Create Search Index".
8. Choose "Vector Search" mode and use the visual or JSON editors. For example:
   ```json
   {
     "fields": [
       {
         "type": "vector",
         "path": "<field-name>",
         "numDimensions": 1536, // any other value
         "similarity": "<similarity-function>"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

9. Adjust the "dimensions" value according to your embedding model (For example, `1536` for OpenAI's `text-embedding-small-3`).
10. Name your index and create.

Make sure to note the following values which are required when configuring the node:

- Collection name
- Vector index name 
- Field names for embeddings and metadata

## Node usage patterns

You can use the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node in the following patterns:

### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents

You can use the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (the template uses the Supabase Vector Store, but the pattern is the same).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

You can connect the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index.md) to use the vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore.md) node with the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node to fetch documents from the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/index.md) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the linked example uses Pinecone, but the pattern is the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> MongoDB Atlas Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore.md) to summarize results and answer questions from the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarize data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/) (the linked example uses the In-Memory Vector Store, but the pattern is the same) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> In-Memory Vector store.

## Node usage patterns

You can use the PGVector Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents

You can use the PGVector Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the PGVector Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (the template uses the Supabase Vector Store, but the pattern is the same).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

You can connect the PGVector Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index.md) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> PGVector Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore.md) node with the PGVector Vector Store node to fetch documents from the PGVector Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/index.md) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the linked example uses Pinecone, but the pattern is the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> PGVector Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore.md) to summarize results and answer questions from the PGVector Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the PGVector Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/) (the linked example uses the Simple Vector Store, but the pattern is the same) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Simple Vector store.

# Pinecone Vector Store node

Use the Pinecone node to interact with your Pinecone database as [vector store](/glossary.md#ai-vector-store). You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a [chain](/glossary.md#ai-chain), or connect directly to an [agent](/glossary.md#ai-agent) as a [tool](/glossary.md#ai-tool).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Pinecone node, and links to more resources.

## Node usage patterns

You can use the Pinecone Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert, update, and retrieve documents

You can use the Pinecone Vector Store as a regular node to insert, update, or get documents. This pattern places the Pinecone Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2165-chat-with-pdf-docs-using-ai-quoting-sources/).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

You can connect the Pinecone Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index.md) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Pinecone Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore.md) node with the Pinecone Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Pinecone Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/index.md) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Pinecone Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore.md) to summarize results and answer questions from the Pinecone Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Pinecone Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2705-chat-with-github-api-documentation-rag-powered-chatbot-with-pinecone-and-openai/) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Pinecone Vector store.

Supabase provides a [quickstart for setting up your vector store](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/langchain?database-method=sql){:target=_blank .external-link}. If you use settings other than the defaults in the quickstart, this may affect parameter settings in n8n. Make sure you understand what you're doing.

## Node usage patterns

You can use the Supabase Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert, update, and retrieve documents

You can use the Supabase Vector Store as a regular node to insert, update, or get documents. This pattern places the Supabase Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

## Node usage patterns

You can use the Zep Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert, update, and retrieve documents

You can use the Zep Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the Zep Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (the example uses Supabase, but the pattern is the same).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

You can connect the Zep Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index.md) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Zep Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore.md) node with the Zep Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Zep Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/index.md) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the example uses Pinecone, but the pattern in the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Zep Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore.md) to summarize results and answer questions from the Zep Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Zep Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (this example uses Supabase, but the pattern is the same) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Zep Vector store.

# Default Data Loader node

Use the Default Data Loader node to load binary data files or JSON data for [vector stores](/glossary.md#ai-vector-store) or summarization.

On this page, you'll find a list of parameters the Default Data Loader node supports, and links to more resources.

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-node-expression-resolution.md"

## Node parameters

* **Type of Data**: Select **Binary** or **JSON**.
* **Data Format**: Displays when you set **Type of Data** to **Binary**. Select the file MIME type for your binary data. Set to **Automatically Detect by MIME Type** if you want n8n to set the data format for you. If you set a specific data format and the incoming file MIME type doesn't match it, the node errors. If you use **Automatically Detect by MIME Type**, the node falls back to text format if it can't match the file MIME type to a supported data format.
* **Mode**: Choose from:
	* **Load All Input Data**: Use all the node's input data.
	* **Load Specific Data**: Use [expressions](/code/expressions.md) to define the data you want to load. You can add text as well as expressions. This means you can create a custom document from a mix of text and expressions.

## Node options

* **Metadata**: Set the metadata that should accompany the document in the vector store. This is what you match to using the **Metadata Filter** option when retrieving data using the vector store nodes.

# Ollama Chat Model node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Ollama Chat Model node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatollama/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Processing parameters

The Ollama Chat Model node is a [sub-node](/glossary.md#sub-node-n8n). Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.

Most nodes, including [root nodes](/glossary.md#root-node-n8n), take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Can't connect to a remote Ollama instance

The Ollama Chat Model node is only designed to connect to a locally hosted Ollama instance. It doesn't include the authentication features you'd need to connect to a remotely hosted Ollama instance.

To use the Ollama Chat Model, follow the [Ollama credentials instructions](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama.md) to set up Ollama locally and configure the instance URL in n8n.

## Can't connect to a local Ollama instance when using Docker

The Ollama Chat Model node connects to a locally hosted Ollama instance using the base URL defined by [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama.md). When you run either n8n or Ollama in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Ollama.

Ollama typically listens for connections on `localhost`, the local network address. In Docker, by default, each container has its own `localhost` which is only accessible from within the container. If either n8n or Ollama are running in containers, they won't be able to connect over `localhost`.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only Ollama is in Docker

If only Ollama is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When running the container, [publish the ports](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/) with the `-p` flag. By default, Ollama runs on port 11434, so your Docker command should look like this:

```shell
docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
```

When configuring [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama.md), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **base URL** to `http://localhost:11434`).

### If only n8n is in Docker

If only n8n is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` on the host.

If you are running n8n in Docker on **Linux**, use the `--add-host` flag to map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` when you start the container. For example:

```shell
docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.

When configuring [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama.md), use `host.docker.internal` as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, to bind to the default port 11434, you could set the base URL to `http://host.docker.internal:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in separate Docker containers

If both n8n and Ollama are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When configuring [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama.md), use the Ollama container's name as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you call the Ollama container `my-ollama` and it listens on the default port 11434, you would set the base URL to `http://my-ollama:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container

If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the `localhost` address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure Ollama to listen on localhost and configure the base URL in the [Ollama credentials in n8n](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama.md) to use localhost: `http://localhost:11434`.

<!-- vale from-microsoft.HeadingColons = NO -->
## Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434
<!-- vale from-microsoft.HeadingColons = YES -->

This error occurs when your computer has IPv6 enabled, but Ollama is listening to an IPv4 address.

To fix this, change the base URL in your [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama.md) to connect to `127.0.0.1`, the IPv4-specific local address, instead of the `localhost` alias that can resolve to either IPv4 or IPv6: `http://127.0.0.1:11434`.

Use this option to control the chances of the model talking about new topics. Higher values increase the chance of the model talking about new topics.

### Sampling Temperature

Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.

### Timeout

Enter the maximum request time in milliseconds.

### Max Retries

Enter the maximum number of times to retry a request.

### Top P

Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.

# Ollama Model node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Ollama Model node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmollama/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Processing parameters

The Ollama Model node is a [sub-node](/glossary.md#sub-node-n8n). Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.

Most nodes, including [root nodes](/glossary.md#root-node-n8n), take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Can't connect to a remote Ollama instance

The Ollama Model node is only designed to connect to a locally hosted Ollama instance. It doesn't include the authentication features you'd need to connect to a remotely hosted Ollama instance.

To use the Ollama Model, follow the [Ollama credentials instructions](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama.md) to set up Ollama locally and configure the instance URL in n8n.

## Can't connect to a local Ollama instance when using Docker

The Ollama Model node connects to a locally hosted Ollama instance using the base URL defined by [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama.md). When you run either n8n or Ollama in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Ollama.

Ollama typically listens for connections on `localhost`, the local network address. In Docker, by default, each container has its own `localhost` which is only accessible from within the container. If either n8n or Ollama are running in containers, they won't be able to connect over `localhost`.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only Ollama is in Docker

If only Ollama is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When running the container, [publish the ports](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/) with the `-p` flag. By default, Ollama runs on port 11434, so your Docker command should look like this:

```shell
docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
```

When configuring [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama.md), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **base URL** to `http://localhost:11434`).

### If only n8n is in Docker

If only n8n is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` on the host.

If you are running n8n in Docker on **Linux**, use the `--add-host` flag to map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` when you start the container. For example:

```shell
docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.

When configuring [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama.md), use `host.docker.internal` as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, to bind to the default port 11434, you could set the base URL to `http://host.docker.internal:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in separate Docker containers

If both n8n and Ollama are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When configuring [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama.md), use the Ollama container's name as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you call the Ollama container `my-ollama` and it listens on the default port 11434, you would set the base URL to `http://my-ollama:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container

If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the `localhost` address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure Ollama to listen on localhost and configure the base URL in the [Ollama credentials in n8n](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama.md) to use localhost: `http://localhost:11434`.

<!-- vale from-microsoft.HeadingColons = NO -->
## Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434
<!-- vale from-microsoft.HeadingColons = YES -->

This error occurs when your computer has IPv6 enabled, but Ollama is listening to an IPv4 address.

To fix this, change the base URL in your [Ollama credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama.md) to connect to `127.0.0.1`, the IPv4-specific local address, instead of the `localhost` alias that can resolve to either IPv4 or IPv6: `http://127.0.0.1:11434`.

# Simple Memory node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Simple Memory node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorybufferwindow/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Single memory instance

If you add more than one Simple Memory node to your workflow, all nodes access the same memory instance by default. Be careful when doing destructive actions that override existing memory contents, such as the override all messages operation in the [Chat Memory Manager](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager.md) node. If you want more than one memory instance in your workflow, set different session IDs in different memory nodes.

## Managing the Session ID

In most cases, the `sessionId` is automatically retrieved from the **On Chat Message** trigger. But you may run into an error with the phrase `No sessionId`.

If you have this error, first check the output of your Chat trigger to ensure it includes a `sessionId`.

If you're not using the **On Chat Message** trigger, you'll need to manage sessions manually.

For testing purposes, you can use a static key like `my_test_session`. If you use this approach, be sure to set up proper session management before activating the workflow to avoid potential issues in a live environment.

# Structured Output Parser node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Structured Output Parser node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Processing parameters

The Structured Output Parser node is a [sub-node](/glossary.md#sub-node-n8n). Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.

Most nodes, including [root nodes](/glossary.md#root-node-n8n), take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Adding the structured output parser node to AI nodes

You can attach output parser nodes to select [AI root nodes](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/index.md).

To add the Structured Output Parser to a node, enable the **Require Specific Output Format** option in the AI root node you wish to format. Once the option is enabled, a new **output parser** attachment point is displayed. Click the **output parser** attachment point to add the Structured Output Parser node to the node.

## Using the structured output parser to format intermediary steps

The Structured Output Parser node structures the final output from AI agents. It's not intended to structure intermediary output to pass to other AI tools or stages.

To request a specific format for intermediary output, include the response structure in the **System Message** for the **AI Agent**. The message can include either a schema or example response for the agent to use as a template for its results.

## Structuring output from agents

Structured output parsing is often not reliable when working with [agents](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index.md).

If your workflow uses agents, n8n recommends using a separate [LLM-chain](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm.md) to receive the data from the agent and parse it. This leads to better, more consistent results than parsing directly in the agent workflow.

You can identify which tool version is in your workflow by checking if the node has an **Add option** property when you open the node on the canvas. If that button is present, you're using the new version, not the one described on this page.
///

The HTTP Request tool works just like the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) node, but it's designed to be used with an [AI agent](/glossary.md#ai-agent) as a tool to collect information from a website or API.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the HTTP Request node supports and links to more resources.

# MCP Client Tool node

The MCP Client Tool node is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) client, allowing you to use the tools exposed by an external MCP server. You can connect the MCP Client Tool node to your models to call external tools with n8n agents.

///  note  | Credentials
The MCP Client Tool node supports both [Bearer](/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest.md#using-bearer-auth) and generic [header](/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest.md#using-header-auth) authentication methods.
///

## Node parameters

Configure the node with the following parameters.

* **SSE Endpoint**: The SSE endpoint for the MCP server you want to connect to.
* **Authentication**: The authentication method for authentication to your MCP server. The MCP tool supports [bearer](/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest.md#using-bearer-auth) and generic [header](/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest.md#using-header-auth) authentication. Select **None** to attempt to connect without authentication.
* **Tools to Include**: Choose which tools you want to expose to the AI Agent:
	* **All**: Expose all the tools given by the MCP server.
	* **Selected**: Activates a **Tools to Include** parameter where you can select the tools you want to expose to the AI Agent.
	* **All Except**: Activates a **Tools to Exclude** parameter where you can select the tools you want to avoid sharing with the AI Agent. The AI Agent will have access to all MCP server's tools that aren't selected.

# SearXNG Tool node

The SearXNG Tool node allows you to integrate search capabilities into your workflows using SearXNG. SearXNG aggregates results from multiple search engines without tracking you.

On this page, you'll find the node options for the SearXNG Tool node, and links to more resources.

/// note | Credentials
You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/searxng.md).
///

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-node-expression-resolution.md"

## Node Options

* **Number of Results**: The number of results to retrieve. The default is 10.
* **Page Number**: The page number of the search results to retrieve. The default is 1.
* **Language**: A two-letter [language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) to filter search results by language. For example: `en` for English, `fr` for French. The default is `en`.
* **Safe Search**: Enables or disables filtering explicit content in the search results. Can be None, Moderate, or Strict. The default is None.

## Running a SearXNG instance

This node requires running the SearXNG service on the same network as your n8n instance. Ensure your n8n instance has network access to the SearXNG service.

This node requires results in JSON format, which isn't enabled in the default SearXNG configuration. To enable JSON output, add `json` to the `search.formats` section of your SearXNG instance's `settings.yml` file:

```yaml
search:
  # options available for formats: [html, csv, json, rss]
  formats:
    - html
    - json
```

If the `formats` section isn't there, add it. The exact location of the `settings.yml` file depends on how you installed SearXNG. You can find more by visiting the [SearXNG configuration documentation](https://docs.searxng.org/admin/installation-searxng.html#configuration).

The quality and availability of search results depend on the configuration and health of the SearXNG instance you use.

# Think Tool node

The Think Tool node is a [tool](/glossary.md#ai-tool) that invites an [agent](/glossary.md#ai-agent) to do some thinking before answering. Essentially, it allows the agent to reflect on the question by talking to itself before providing an answer. In particular, this is useful for complex queries that require a thoughtful response.

[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'think-tool') ]]

### Prompting example

As an example, say you ask the agent:

<!-- vale off -->
> *Jack is looking at Anne. Anne is looking at George. Jack is married, George is not, and we don't know if Anne is married. Is a married person looking at an unmarried person?*
<!-- vale on -->
	
The agent will do its thinking with the tool:

<!-- vale off -->
> *We have the following information: 1. Jack is looking at Anne. 2. Anne is looking at George. 3. Jack is married. 4. George is not married. 5. We don't know if Anne is married or not.*

> *We need to determine if a married person is looking at an unmarried person. Let's consider both cases for Anne:*

> *Case 1: Anne is married.*

> - *If Anne is married, then she (married) is looking at George (unmarried). In this case, a married person (Anne) is looking at an unmarried person (George).*

> *Case 2: Anne is unmarried.*

> - *If Anne is unmarried, then Jack (married) is looking at Anne (unmarried). In this case, a married person (Jack) is looking at an unmarried person (Anne).*

> *In both scenarios, we find that a married person is looking at an unmarried person. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes.*
<!-- vale on -->
	
and then afterward provide the answer:

<!-- vale off -->
> *Yes, a married person is looking at an unmarried person. In both possible scenarios regarding Anne's marital status, we find that a married individual (either Jack or Anne) is looking at an unmarried individual (either George or Anne).*
<!-- vale on -->

# Call n8n Workflow Tool node

The Call n8n Workflow Tool node is a [tool](/glossary.md#ai-tool) that allows an [agent](/glossary.md#ai-agent) to run another n8n workflow and fetch its output data. 

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Call n8n Workflow Tool node, and links to more resources.

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-node-expression-resolution.md"

## Node parameters

### Description

Enter a custom code a description. This tells the agent when to use this tool. For example:

> Call this tool to get a random color. The input should be a string with comma separated names of colors to exclude.

### Source

Tell n8n which workflow to call. You can choose either:

* **Database** to select the workflow from a list or enter a workflow ID.
* **Define Below** and copy in a complete [workflow JSON](/workflows/export-import.md).

### Workflow Inputs

When using **Database** as workflow source, once you choose a sub-workflow (and define the **Workflow Input Schema** in the sub-workflow), you can define the **Workflow Inputs**.

Select the **Refresh** button to pull in the input fields from the sub-workflow.

You can define the workflow input values using any combination of the following options:

* providing fixed values
* using expressions to reference data from the current workflow
* [letting the AI model specify the parameter](/advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function.md) by selecting the button AI button on the right side of the field
* using the [`$fromAI()` function](/advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function.md#use-the-fromai-function) in expressions to control the way the model fills in data and to mix AI generated input with other custom input

To reference data from the current workflow, drag fields from the input panel to the field with the Expressions mode selected.

To get started with the `$fromAI()` function, select the "Let the model define this parameter" button on the right side of the field and then use the **X** on the box to revert to user-defined values. The field will change to an expression field pre-populated with the `$fromAI()` expression. From here, you can customize the expression to add other static or dynamic content, or tweak the `$fromAI()` function parameters.

# Aggregate

Use the Aggregate node to take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.

## Node parameters

To begin using the node, select the **Aggregate** you'd like to use:

* [**Individual Fields**](#individual-fields): Aggregate individual fields separately.
* [**All Item Data**](#all-item-data): Aggregate all item data into a single list.

### Individual Fields

* **Input Field Name**: Enter the name of the field in the input data to aggregate together.
* **Rename Field**: This toggle controls whether to give the field a different name in the aggregated output data. Turn this on to add a different field name. If you're aggregating multiple fields, you must provide new output field names. You can't leave multiple fields undefined.
	* **Output Field Name**: This field is displayed when you turn on **Rename Field**. Enter the field name for the aggregated output data.

Refer to [Node options](#node-options) for more configuration options.

### All Item Data

* **Put Output in Field**: Enter the name of the field to output the data in.
* **Include**: Select which fields to include in the output. Choose from:
	* **All fields**: The output includes data from all fields with no further parameters.
	* **Specified Fields**: If you select this option, enter a comma-separated list of fields the output should include data from in the **Fields To Include** parameter. The output will include only the fields in this list.
	* **All Fields Except**: If you select this option, enter a comma-separated list of fields the output should exclude data from in the **Fields To Exclude** parameter. The output will include all fields not in this list.

Refer to [Node options](#node-options) for more configuration options.

## Node options

You can further configure this node using these **Options**:

* **Disable Dot Notation**: The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. It controls whether to disallow referencing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name (turned on), or allow it (turned off, default).
* **Merge Lists**: The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. Turn it on if the field to aggregate is a list and you want to output a single flat list rather than a list of lists.
* **Include Binaries**: The node displays this toggle for both Aggregate types. Turn it on if you want to include binary data from the input in the new output.
* **Keep Missing And Null Values**: The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. Turn it on to add a null (empty) entry in the output list when there is a null or missing value in the input. If turned off, the output ignores null or empty values.

```javascript
[
  {
    "json": {
	  // your data goes here
	}
  }
]
```

To troubleshoot this error, check the following:

* Read the [data structure](/data/data-structure.md) to understand the data you receive in the Code node and the requirements for outputting data from the node.
* Understand how data items work and how to connect data items from previous nodes with [item linking](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/index.md).

<!-- vale off -->
## A 'json' property isn't an object
<!-- vale on -->

This error occurs when the Code node returns data where the `json` key isn't pointing to an object.

This may happen if you set `json` to a different data structure, like an array:

```javascript
[
  {
    "json": [
	  // Setting `json` to an array like this will produce an error
	]
  }
]
```

To resolve this, ensure that the `json` key references an object in your return data:

```javascript
[
  {
    "json": {
	  // Setting `json` to an object as expected
	}
  }
]
```

## Code doesn't return an object

This error may occur when your Code node doesn't return anything or if it returns an unexpected result.

To resolve this, ensure that your Code node returns the [expected data structure](/data/data-structure.md):

```javascript
[
  {
    "json": {
	  // your data goes here
	}
  }
]
```

This error may also occur if the code you provided returns `'undefined'` instead of the expected result. In that case, ensure that the data you are referencing in your Code node exists in each execution and that it has the structure your code expects.

## 'import' and 'export' may only appear at the top level

This error occurs if you try to use `import` or `export` in the Code node. These aren't supported by n8n's JavaScript sandbox. Instead, use the `require` function to load modules.

To resolve this issue, try changing your `import` statements to use `require`:

```javascript
// Original code:
// import express from "express";
// New code:
const express = require("express");
```

<!-- vale off -->
## Cannot find module '&lt;module&gt;'
<!-- vale on -->

This error occurs if you try to use `require` in the Code node and n8n can't find the module.

/// warning | Only for self-hosted
n8n doesn't support importing modules in the [Cloud](/manage-cloud/overview.md) version.
///

If you're [self-hosting](/hosting/index.md) n8n, follow these steps:

* Install the module into your n8n environment.
	* If you are running n8n with [npm](/hosting/installation/npm.md), install the module in the same environment as n8n.
	* If you are running n8n with [Docker](/hosting/installation/docker.md), you need to extend the official n8n image with a [custom image](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/base-images/){:target=_blank .external-link} that includes your module.
* Set the `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN` and `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL` [environment variables](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node.md) to allow importing modules.

## Using global variables

Sometimes you may wish to set and retrieve simple global data related to a workflow across and within executions. For example, you may wish to include the date of the previous report when compiling a report with a list of project updates.

To set, update, and retrieve data directly to a workflow, use the [static data](/code/cookbook/builtin/get-workflow-static-data.md) functions within your code. You can manage data either globally or tied to specific nodes.

/// info | Use Remove Duplicates when possible
If you're interested in using variables to avoid processing the same data items more than once, consider using the [Remove Duplicates node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/index.md) instead. The Remove Duplicates node can save information across executions to avoid processing the same items multiple times.

# Compare Datasets

The Compare Datasets node helps you compare data from two input streams.

## Node parameters

1. Decide which fields to compare. In **Input A Field**, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream A. In **Input B Field**, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream B. 
2. **Optional**: You can compare by multiple fields. Select **Add Fields to Match** to set up more comparisons.
3. Choose how to handle differences between the datasets. In **When There Are Differences**, select one of the following:
	* **Use Input A Version** to treat input stream A as the source of truth.
	* **Use Input B Version** to treat input stream B as the source of truth.
	* **Use a Mix of Versions** to use different inputs for different fields.
		* Use **Prefer** to select either **Input A Version** or **Input B Version** as the main source of truth.
		* Enter input fields that are exceptions to **For Everything Except** to pull from the other input source. To add multiple input fields, enter a comma-separated list.
	* **Include Both Versions** to include both input streams in the output, which may make the structure more complex.
4. Decide whether to use **Fuzzy Compare**. When turned on, the comparison will tolerate small type differences when comparing fields. For example, the number 3 and the string `3` are treated as the same with **Fuzzy Compare** turned on, but wouldn't be treated the same with it turned off.

## Understand item comparison

Item comparison is a two stage process:

1. n8n checks if the values of the fields you selected to compare match across both inputs.
2. If the fields to compare match, n8n then compares all fields within the items, to determine if the items are the same or different.

## Node options

Use the node **Options** to refine your comparison or tweak comparison behavior.

### Fields to Skip Comparing

Enter field names that you want to ignore in the comparison.

For example, if you compare the two datasets below using `person.language` as the **Fields to Match**, n8n returns them as different. If you add `person.name` to **Fields to Skip Comparing**, n8n returns them as matching.

```json
	// Input 1
	[
		{
			"person":
			{
				"name":	"Stefan",
				"language":	"de"
			}
		},
		{
			"person":
			{
				"name":	"Jim",
				"language":	"en"
			}
		},
		{
			"person":
			{
				"name":	"Hans",
				"language":	"de"
			}
		}
	]
	// Input 2
		[
		{
			"person":
			{
				"name":	"Sara",
				"language":	"de"
			}
		},
		{
			"person":
			{
				"name":	"Jane",
				"language":	"en"
			}
		},
		{
			"person":
			{
				"name":	"Harriet",
				"language":	"de"
			}
		}
	]
```

### Disable Dot Notation

Whether to disallow referencing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name (turned on) or allow it (turned off, default).

### Multiple Matches

Choose how to handle duplicate data. The default is **Include All Matches**. You can choose **Include First Match Only**.

For example, given these two datasets:
```json
	// Input 1
	[
		{
			"fruit": {
				"type": "apple",
				"color": "red"
			}
		},
				{
			"fruit": {
				"type": "apple",
				"color": "red"
			}
		},
				{
			"fruit": {
				"type": "banana",
				"color": "yellow"
			}
		}
	]
	// Input 2
	[
		{
			"fruit": {
				"type": "apple",
				"color": "red"
			}
		},
				{
			"fruit": {
				"type": "apple",
				"color": "red"
			}
		},
				{
			"fruit": {
				"type": "banana",
				"color": "yellow"
			}
		}
	]
```

n8n returns three items in the **Same Branch** tab. The data is the same in both branches.

If you select **Include First Match Only**, n8n returns two items, in the **Same Branch** tab. The data is the same in both branches, but n8n only returns the first occurrence of the matching "apple" items.


## Understand the output

There are four output options:

* **In A only Branch**: Contains data that occurs only in the first input.
* **Same Branch**: Contains data that's the same in both inputs.
* **Different Branch**: Contains data that's different between inputs.
* **In B only Branch**: Contains data that occurs only in the second output.

# Error Trigger node

You can use the Error Trigger node to create error workflows. When another linked workflow fails, this node gets details about the failed workflow and the errors, and runs the error workflow.

## Usage

--8<-- "_snippets/flow-logic/create-set-error-workflow.md"


Note the following:

* If a workflow uses the Error Trigger node, you don't have to activate the workflow.
* If a workflow contains the Error Trigger node, by default, the workflow uses itself as the error workflow.
* You can't test error workflows when running workflows manually. The Error Trigger only runs when an automatic workflow errors.

# Execute Command node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Execute Command node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

<!-- vale off -->
## Command failed: &lt;command&gt; /bin/sh: &lt;command&gt;: not found
<!-- vale on -->

This error occurs when the shell environment can't find one of the commands in the **Command** parameter.

To fix this error, review the following:

* Check that the command and its arguments don't have typos in the **Command** parameter.
* Check that the command is in the `PATH` of the user running n8n. 
* If you are running n8n with Docker, check if the command is available within the container by trying to run it manually. If your command isn't included in the container, you might have to extend the official n8n image with a [custom image](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/base-images/){:target=_blank .external-link} that includes your command.
	* If n8n is already running:
		```sh
		# Find n8n's container ID, it will be the first column
		docker ps | grep n8n
		# Try to execute the command within the running container
		docker container exec <container_ID> <command_to_run>
		```
	* If n8n isn't running:
		```sh
		# Start up a new container that runs the command instead of n8n
		# Use the same image and tag that you use to run n8n normally
		docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/sh docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n -c <command_to_run>
		```

<!-- vale off -->
## Error: stdout maxBuffer length exceeded
<!-- vale on -->

This error happens when your command returns more output than the Execute Command node is able to process at one time.

To avoid this error, reduce output your command produces. Check your command's manual page or documentation to see if there are flags to limit or filter output. If not, you may need to pipe the output to another command to remove unneeded info.

# Execute Command

The Execute Command node runs shell commands on the host machine that runs n8n.

/// note | Which shell runs the command?
This node executes the command in the default shell of the host machine. For example, `cmd` on Windows and `zsh` on macOS.

If you run n8n with Docker, your command will run in the n8n container and not the Docker host.
///

/// note | Not available on Cloud
This node isn't available on n8n Cloud.
///

## Node parameters

Configure the node using the following parameters.

### Execute Once

Choose whether you want the node to execute only once (turned on) or once for every item it receives as input (turned off).

### Command

Enter the command to execute on the host machine. Refer to sections below for examples of running [multiple commands](#run-multiple-commands) and [cURL commands](#run-curl-command).

#### Run multiple commands

Use one of two methods to run multiple commands in one Execute Command node:

* Enter each command on one line separated by `&&`. For example, you can combine the change directory (cd) command with the list (ls) command using `&&`.

    ```bash
    cd bin && ls
    ```

* Enter each command on a separate line. For example, you can write the list (ls) command on a new line after the change directory (cd) command.

    ```bash
    cd bin
    ls
    ```

#### Run cURL command

You can also use the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) node to make a cURL request.

If you want to run the curl command in the Execute Command node, you will have to build a Docker image based on the existing n8n image. The default n8n Docker image uses Alpine Linux. You will have to install the curl package.

1. Create a file named `Dockerfile`.
2. Add the below code snippet to the Dockerfile.

    ```shell
    FROM docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
    USER root
    RUN apk --update add curl
    USER node
    ```

3. In the same folder, execute the command below to build the Docker image.

    ```shell
    docker build -t n8n-curl
    ```

4. Replace the Docker image you used before. For example, replace `docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n` with `n8n-curl`.
5. Run the newly created Docker image. You'll now be able to execute ssh using the Execute Command Node.

# Execute Sub-workflow

Use the Execute Sub-workflow node to run a different workflow on the host machine that runs n8n.

## Node parameters

### Source

Select where the node should get the sub-workflow's information from:

- **Database**: Select this option to load the workflow from the database by ID. You must also enter either:
	- **From list**: Select the workflow from a list of workflows available to your account.
	- **Workflow ID**: Enter the ID for the workflow. The URL of the workflow contains the ID after `/workflow/`. For example, if the URL of a workflow is `https://my-n8n-acct.app.n8n.cloud/workflow/abCDE1f6gHiJKL7`, the **Workflow ID** is `abCDE1f6gHiJKL7`.
- **Local File**: Select this option to load the workflow from a locally saved JSON file. You must also enter:
	- **Workflow Path**: Enter the path to the local JSON workflow file you want the node to execute.
- **Parameter**: Select this option to load the workflow from a parameter. You must also enter:
	- **Workflow JSON**: Enter the JSON code you want the node to execute.
- **URL**: Select this option to load the workflow from a URL. You must also enter:
	- **Workflow URL**: Enter the URL you want to load the workflow from.

### Workflow Inputs

If you select a sub-workflow using the **database** and **From list** options, the sub-workflow's input items will automatically display, ready for you to fill in or map values.

You can optionally remove requested input items, in which case the sub-workflow receives `null` as the item's value. You can also enable **Attempt to convert types** to try to automatically convert data to the sub-workflow item's requested type.

Input items won't appear if the sub-workflow's Workflow Input Trigger node uses the "Accept all data" input data mode.

### Mode

Use this parameter to control the execution mode for the node. Choose from these options:

- **Run once with all items**: Pass all input items into a single execution of the node.
- **Run once for each item**: Execute the node once for each input item in turn.

## Node options

This node includes one option: **Wait for Sub-Workflow Completion**. This lets you control whether the main workflow should wait for the sub-workflow's completion before moving on to the next step (turned on) or whether the main workflow should continue without waiting (turned off).

# Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node

Use this node to start a workflow in response to another workflow. It should be the first node in the workflow.

n8n allows you to call workflows from other workflows. This is useful if you want to:

* Reuse a workflow: for example, you could have multiple workflows pulling and processing data from different sources, then have all those workflows call a single workflow that generates a report.
* Break large workflows into smaller components.

## Usage

This node runs in response to a call from the [Execute Sub-workflow](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow.md) or [Call n8n Workflow Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow.md) nodes.

# Execution Data

Use this node to save metadata for workflow executions. You can then search by this data in the **Executions** list.

You can retrieve custom execution data during workflow execution using the Code node. Refer to [Custom executions data](/workflows/executions/custom-executions-data.md) for more information.

/// info | Feature availability
Available on Pro and Enterprise plans.
///

## Operations

* Save Execution Data for Search

## Data to Save

Add a **Saved Field** for each key/value pair of metadata you'd like to save.

## Limitations

The Execution Data node has the following restrictions when storing execution metadata:

* `key`: limited to 50 characters
* `value`: limited to 512 characters

If either the `key` or `value` exceed the above limitations, n8n truncates to their maximum length and outputs a log entry.

# Extract From File

A common pattern in n8n workflows is to receive a file, either from and [HTTP Request node][] (for files you are fetching from a website), a [Webhook Node][] (for files which are sent to your workflow from elsewhere), or from a local source. Data obtained in this way is often in a binary format, for example a spreadsheet or PDF.

The Extract From File node extracts data from a binary format file and converts it to JSON, which can then be easily manipulated by the rest of your workflow. For converting JSON back into a binary file type, please see the [Convert to File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile.md) node.

## Operations

Use the **Operations** drop-down to select the format of the source file to extract data from.

- **Extract From CSV**: The "Comma Separated Values" file type is commonly used for tabulated data.
- **Extract From HTML**: Extract fields from standard web page HTML format files.
- **Extract From JSON**: Extract JSON data from a binary file.
- **Extract From ICS**: Extract fields from iCalendar format files.
- **Extract From ODS**: Extract fields from ODS spreadsheet files.
- **Extract From PDF**: Extract fields from Portable Document Format files.
- **Extract From RTF**: Extract fields from Rich Text Format files.
- **Extract From Text File**: Extract fields from a standard text file format.
- **Extract From XLS**: Extract fields from a Microsoft Excel file (older format).
- **Extract From XLSX**: Extract fields from a Microsoft Excel file.
- **Move File to Base64 String**: Converts binary data to a text-friendly [base64][] format.

## Example workflow

In this example, a Webhook node is used to trigger the workflow. When a CSV file is sent to the webhook address, the file data is output and received by the Extract From File node.

[[ workflowDemo("file:///integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/webhook-example.json") ]]

Set to operate as 'Extract from CSV', the node then outputs the data as a series of JSON 'row' objects:

```
{
  "row": {
  "0": "apple",
  "1": "1",
  "2": "2",
  "3": "3"
  }
  ...
```

/// tip | Receiving files with a webhook
Select the Webhook Node's **Add Options** button and select **Raw body**, then enable that setting to get the node to output the binary file that the subsequent node is expecting.
///

## Node parameters

### Input Binary Field

Enter the name of the field from the node input data that contains the binary file. The default is 'data'.

### Destination Output Field

Enter the name of the field in the node output that will contain the extracted data.

This parameter is only available for these operations:

- Extract From JSON
- Extract From ICS
- Extract From Text File
- Move File to Base64 String

# Filter

Filter items based on a condition. If the item meets the condition, the Filter node passes it on to the next node in the Filter node output. If the item doesn't meet the condition, the Filter node omits the item from its output.

## Node parameters

Create filter comparison **Conditions** to perform your filter.

- Use the data type dropdown to select the data type and comparison operation type for your condition. For example, to filter for dates after a particular date, select **Date & Time > is after**.
- The fields and values to enter into the condition change based on the data type and comparison you select. Refer to [Available data type comparisons](#available-data-type-comparisons) for a full list of all comparisons by data type.

Select **Add condition** to create more conditions.

### Combining conditions

You can choose to keep items:

* When they meet all conditions: Create two or more conditions and select **AND** in the dropdown between them.
* When they meet any of the conditions: Create two or more conditions and select **OR** in the dropdown between them.

You can't create a mix of AND and OR rules.

## Node options

- **Ignore Case**: Whether to ignore letter case (turned on) or be case sensitive (turned off).
- **Less Strict Type Validation**: Whether you want n8n to attempt to convert value types based on the operator you choose (turned on) or not (turned off). Turn this on when facing a "wrong type:" error in your node.

# n8n Form node

Use the n8n Form node to create user-facing forms with multiple steps. You can add other nodes with custom logic between to process user input. You must start the workflow with the [n8n Form Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger.md).

[[ workflowDemo("file:///integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/mutually-exclusive-branching.json") ]]

## Setting up the node

### Set default selections with query parameters

You can set the initial values for fields by using [query parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Web_forms){:target=_blank .external-link} with the initial URL provided by the [n8n Form Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger.md). Every page in the form receives the same query parameters sent to the n8n Form Trigger URL.

/// note | Only for production
Query parameters are only available when using the form in production mode. n8n won't populate field values from query parameters in testing mode.
///

<!-- vale from-microsoft.Percentages = NO -->
When using query parameters, [percent-encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding){:target=_blank .external-link} any field names or values that use special characters. This ensures n8n uses the initial values for the given fields. You can use tools like [URL Encode/Decode](https://www.url-encode-decode.com/) to format your query parameters using percent-encoding.

As an example, imagine you have a form with the following properties:

* Production URL: `https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form`
* Fields:
	* `name`: `Jane Doe`
	* `email`: `jane.doe@example.com`

With query parameters and percent-encoding, you could use the following URL to set initial field values to the data above:

```
https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form?email=jane.doe%40example.com&name=Jane%20Doe
```

Here, percent-encoding replaces the at-symbol (`@`) with the string `%40` and the space character (` `) with the string `%20`. This will set the initial value for these fields no matter which page of the form they appear on.
<!-- vale from-microsoft.Percentages = YES -->

### Displaying custom HTML

You can display custom HTML on your form by adding a **Custom HTML** field to your form. This provides an **HTML** box where you can insert arbitrary HTML code to display as part of the form page.

You can use the HTML field to enrich your form page by including things like links, images, videos, and more. n8n will render the content with the rest of the form fields in the normal document flow.

Because custom HTML content is read-only, these fields aren't included in the form output data by default. To include the raw HTML content in the node output, provide a name for the data using the **Element Name** field.

The HTML field doesn't support `<script>`, `<style>`, or `<input>` elements.

### Including hidden fields

It's possible to include fields in a form without displaying them to users. This is useful when you want to pass extra data to the form that doesn't require interactive user input.

To add fields that won't show up on the form, use the **Hidden Field** form element. There, you can define the **Field Name** and optionally provide a default value by filling out the **Field Value**.

When serving the form, you can pass values for hidden fields using [query parameters](#set-default-selections-with-query-parameters).

### Defining the form using JSON

Use **Define Form** > **Using JSON** to define the fields of your form with a [JSON array of objects](/data/data-structure.md). Each object defines a single field by using a combination of these keys:

- `fieldLabel`: The label that appears above the input field. 
- `fieldType`: Choose from `date`, `dropdown`, `email`, `file`, `number`, `password`, `text`, or `textarea`.
    - Use `date` to include a date picker in the form. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](/code/cookbook/luxon.md) for more information on formatting dates.
	- When using `dropdown`, set the choices with `fieldOptions` (reference the example below). By default, the dropdown is single-choice. To make it multiple-choice, set `multiselect` to `true`.
	- When using `file`, set `multipleFiles` to `true` to allow users to select more than one file. To define the file types to allow, set `acceptFileTypes` to a string containing a comma-separated list of file extensions (reference the example below).
- `placeholder`: Specify placeholder data for the field. You can use this for every `fieldType` except `dropdown`, `date`, and `file`.
- `requiredField`: Require users to complete this field on the form.

An example JSON that shows the general format required and the keys available:

```javascript
// Use the "requiredField" key on any field to mark it as mandatory
// Use the "placeholder" key to specify placeholder data for all fields
//     except 'dropdown', 'date' and 'file'

[
	{
		"fieldLabel": "Date Field",
		"fieldType": "date",
		"formatDate": "mm/dd/yyyy", // how to format received date in n8n
		"requiredField": true
	},
	{
		"fieldLabel": "Dropdown Options",
		"fieldType": "dropdown",
		"fieldOptions": {
			"values": [
				{
					"option": "option 1"
				},
				{
					"option": "option 2"
				}
			]
		},
		"requiredField": true
	},
	{
		"fieldLabel": "Multiselect",
		"fieldType": "dropdown",
		"fieldOptions": {
			"values": [
				{
					"option": "option 1"
				},
				{
					"option": "option 2"
				}
			]
		},
		"multiselect": true // setting to true allows multi-select
	},
	{
		"fieldLabel": "Email",
		"fieldType": "email",
		"placeholder": "me@mail.con"
	},
	{
		"fieldLabel": "File",
		"fieldType": "file",
		"multipleFiles": true, // setting to true allows multiple files selection
		"acceptFileTypes": ".jpg, .png" // allowed file types
	},
	{
		"fieldLabel": "Number",
		"fieldType": "number"
	},
	{
		"fieldLabel": "Password",
		"fieldType": "password"
	},
	{
		// "fieldType": "text" can be omitted since it's the default type
		"fieldLabel": "Text"
	},
	{
		"fieldLabel": "Textarea",
		"fieldType": "textarea"
	}
]
```

### Form Ending

Use the **Form Ending** Page Type to end a form and either show a completion page, redirect the user to a URL, or display custom HTML or text. Only one Form Ending page displays per execution, even when n8n executes [multiple branches](#forms-with-branches) that contain Form Ending nodes.

Choose between these options when using **On n8n Form Submission**:

- **Show Completion Screen**: Shows users a final screen to confirm that they submitted the form.
	- Fill in **Completion Title** to set the `h1` title on the form.
	- n8n displays the **Completion Message** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. Use `\n` or `<br>` to add a line break. 
	- Select **Add option** and fill in **Completion Page Title** to set the page's title in the browser tab.

When using **Redirect to URL**, fill in the **URL** field with the page you want to redirect to when users complete the form.

Use **Show Text** to display a final page defined by arbitrary plain text and HTML. Fill in the **Text** field with the HTML or plain text content you wish to show.

### Forms with branches

The n8n Form node executes and displays its associated form page whenever it receives data from a previous node. When building forms with n8n, to avoid confusion, it's important to understand how forms behave when branching occurs.

#### Workflows with mutually exclusive branches

Form workflows containing mutually exclusive branches work as expected. n8n will execute a single branch according to the submitted data and conditions you outline. As it executes, n8n will display each page in the branch, ending with an n8n Form node with the **Form Ending** page type.

This workflow demonstrates mutually exclusive branching. Each selection can only execute a single branch.

[[ workflowDemo("file:///integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/mutually-exclusive-branching.json") ]]

#### Workflows that may execute multiple branches

Form workflows that send data to multiple branches at the same time require more care. When multiple branches receive data during an execution (for example, from a [switch](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch.md) node), n8n executes each branch that receives data [sequentially](/flow-logic/execution-order.md). Upon reaching the end of one branch, the execution will move to the next branch with data.

n8n only executes a single **Form Ending** n8n Form node for each execution. When multiple branches of a form workflow receive data, n8n ignores all Form Ending nodes except for the one associated with the final branch.

This workflow may execute more than one branch during an execution. Here, n8n executes all valid branches sequentially. This impacts which n8n Form nodes n8n executes (in particular, which **Form Ending** node displays):

[[ workflowDemo("file:///integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/multiple-branch-execution.json") ]]

### Node options

Select **Add Option** to view more configuration options: 

- **Form Title**: The title for your form. n8n displays the **Form Title** as the webpage title and main `h1` title on the form.
- **Form Description**: The description for your form. n8n displays the **Form Description** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. This field supports HTML. Use `\n` or `<br>` to add a line break. The Form Description also populates the [HTML meta description](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name#standard_metadata_names_defined_in_the_html_specification) for the page.
- **Button Label**: The label to use for your form's submit button. n8n displays the **Button Label** as the name of the submit button.

## Running the node

### Build and test workflows

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL** in the [n8n Form Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger.md). Using a test URL ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging. 

There are two ways to test:

- Select **Test Step**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the node and any previous nodes, but not the rest of the workflow.
- Select **Test Workflow**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow.

### Production workflows

When your workflow is ready, switch to using the n8n Form Trigger's **Production URL** by opening the trigger node and selecting the **Production URL** in the **From URLS** selector. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when a user submits the form.

When working with a production URL, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the Form trigger isn't visible in the editor UI with the production URL.

# n8n Form Trigger node

Use the n8n Form trigger to start a workflow when a user submits a form, taking the input data from the form. The node generates the form web page for you to use.

You can add more pages to continue the form with the [n8n Form](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form.md) node.

## Build and test workflows

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL**. Using a test URL ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging. 

There are two ways to test:

- Select **Test Step**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the node, but not the rest of the workflow.
- Select **Test Workflow**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow.

## Production workflows

When your workflow is ready, switch to using the **Production URL**. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when a user submits the form.

When working with a production URL, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the Form trigger isn't visible in the editor UI with the production URL.

## Set default selections with query parameters

You can set the initial values for fields by using [query parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Web_forms){:target=_blank .external-link} with the initial URL provided by the n8n Form Trigger. Every [page in the form](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form.md) receives the same query parameters sent to the n8n Form Trigger URL.

/// note | Only for production
Query parameters are only available when using the form in production mode. n8n won't populate field values from query parameters in testing mode.
///

<!-- vale from-microsoft.Percentages = NO -->
When using query parameters, [percent-encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding){:target=_blank .external-link} any field names or values that use special characters. This ensures n8n uses the initial values for the given fields. You can use tools like [URL Encode/Decode](https://www.url-encode-decode.com/) to format your query parameters using percent-encoding.

As an example, imagine you have a form with the following properties:

* Production URL: `https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form`
* Fields:
	* `name`: `Jane Doe`
	* `email`: `jane.doe@example.com`

With query parameters and percent-encoding, you could use the following URL to set initial field values to the data above:

```
https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form?email=jane.doe%40example.com&name=Jane%20Doe
```

Here, percent-encoding replaces the at-symbol (`@`) with the string `%40` and the space character (` `) with the string `%20`. This will set the initial value for these fields no matter which page of the form they appear on.
<!-- vale from-microsoft.Percentages = YES -->

## Node parameters

These are the main node configuration fields:

### Authentication

- **Basic Auth**
- **None**

#### Using basic auth

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- The **Username** you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting.
- The **Password** that goes with that username.

### Form URLs

The Form Trigger node has two URLs: **Test URL** and **Production URL**. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel. Select **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.

![Screenshot of the form URLs](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/form-trigger/form-urls.png)

- **Test URL**: n8n registers a test webhook when you select **Test Step** or **Test Workflow**, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.
- **Production URL**: n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution. Select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.

### Form Path

Set a custom slug for the form.

### Form Title

Enter the title for your form. n8n displays the **Form Title** as the webpage title and main `h1` title on the form.

### Form Description

Enter the description for your form. n8n displays the **Form Description** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. Use `\n` or `<br>` to add a line break. 

### Form Elements

Create the question fields for your form. Select **Add Form Element** to add a new field.

Every field has the following settings:

- **Field Label**: Enter the label that appears above the input field. 
- **Element Type**: Choose from **Custom HTML**, **Date**, **Dropdown List**, **Email**, **File**, **Hidden Field**, **Number**, **Password**, **Text**, or **Textarea**.
	- Select **Custom HTML** to insert arbitrary HTML.
		- You can include elements like links, images, video, and more. You can't include `<script>`, `<style>`, or `<input>` elements.
		- By default, Custom HTML fields aren't included in the node output. To include the Custom HTML content in the output, fill out the associated **Element Name** field.
    - Select **Date** to include a date picker in the form. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](/code/cookbook/luxon.md) for more information on formatting dates.
	- Select **Dropdown List** > **Add Field Option** to add multiple options. By default, the dropdown is single-choice. To make it multiple-choice, turn on **Multiple Choice**. 
	- Select **Hidden Field** to include a form element without displaying it on the form. You can set a default value using the **Field Value** parameter or pass values for the field using [query parameters](#set-default-selections-with-query-parameters).
- **Required Field**: Turn on to require users to complete this field on the form. 

### Respond When

Choose when n8n sends a response to the form submission. You can respond when:

- **Form Is Submitted**: Send a response to the user as soon as they submit the form.
- **Workflow Finishes**: Use this if you want the workflow to complete its execution before you send a response to the user. If the workflow errors, it sends a response to the user telling them there was a problem submitting the form.

## Node options

Select **Add Option** to view more configuration options: 

- **Append n8n Attribution**: Turn off to hide the **Form automated with n8n** attribute at the bottom of the form.
- **Form Response**: Choose how to respond when the user submits the form. 
    - **Respond With** > **Form Submitted Text**: Show a message to the user.
    - **Respond With** > **Redirect URL**: Send the user to a new page.
- **Ignore Bots**: Turn on to ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers. 
- **Use Workflow Timezone**: Turn on to use the timezone in the [Workflow settings](/workflows/settings.md) instead of UTC (default). This affects the value of the `submittedAt` timestamp in the node output.

# HTTP Request node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [HTTP Request node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Bad request - please check your parameters

This error displays when the node receives a 400 error indicating a bad request. This error most often occurs because:

* You're using an invalid name or value in a **Query Parameter**.
* You're passing array values in a **Query Parameter** but the array isn't formatted correctly. Try using the [**Array Format in Query Parameters**](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md#array-format-in-query-parameters) option.

Review the API documentation for your service to format your query parameters.

<!-- vale off -->
## The resource you are requesting could not be found
<!-- vale on -->

This error displays when the endpoint **URL** you entered is invalid.

This may be due to a typo in the URL or a deprecated API. Refer to your service's API documentation to verify you have a valid endpoint.

## JSON parameter need to be an valid JSON

This error displays when you've passed a parameter as JSON and it's not formatted as valid JSON.

To resolve, review the JSON you've entered for these issues:

* Test your JSON in a JSON checker or syntax parser to find errors like missing quotation marks, extra or missing commas, incorrectly formatted arrays, extra or missing square brackets or curly brackets, and so on.
* If you've used an **Expression** in the node, be sure you've wrapped the entire JSON in double curly brackets, for example:
    ```
    {{
        {
        "myjson":
        {
            "name1": "value1",
            "name2": "value2",
            "array1":
                ["value1","value2"]
        }
        }
    }}
    ```

## Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials

This error displays when the node receives a 403 error indicating authentication failed.

To resolve, review the selected credentials and make sure you can authenticate with them. You may need to:

* Update permissions or scopes so that your API key or account can perform the operation you've selected.
* Format your generic credential in a different way.
* Generate a new API key or token with the appropriate permissions or scopes.

## 429 - The service is receiving too many requests from you

This error displays when the node receives a [429 error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429){:target=_blank .external-link} from the service that you're calling. This often means that you have hit the rate limits of that service. You can find out more on the [Handling API rate limits](/integrations/builtin/rate-limits.md) page.

To resolve the error, you can use one of the built-in options of the HTTP request node:

### Batching

Use this option to send requests in batches and introduce a delay between them.

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option > Batching**.
1. Set **Items per Batch** to the number of input items to include in each request.
1. Set **Batch Interval (ms)** to introduce a delay between requests in milliseconds. For example, to send one request to an API per second, set **Batch Interval (ms)** to `1000`.

### Retry on Fail

Use this option to retry the node after a failed attempt.

1. In the HTTP Request node, go to **Settings** and enable **Retry on Fail**.
1. Set **Max Tries** to the maximum number of times n8n should retry the node.
1. Set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to the desired delay in milliseconds between retries. For example, to wait one second before retrying the request again, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000`.

# HTTP Request node

The HTTP Request node is one of the most versatile nodes in n8n. It allows you to make HTTP requests to query data from any app or service with a REST API. You can use the HTTP Request node a regular node or attached to an [AI agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent.md) to use as a [tool](/advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools.md){ data-preview }.

When using this node, you're creating a REST API call. You need some understanding of basic API terminology and concepts.

There are two ways to create an HTTP request: configure the [node parameters](#node-parameters) or [import a curl command](#import-curl-command).

/// note | Credentials
Refer to [HTTP Request credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest.md) for guidance on setting up authentication. 
///

## Node parameters

### Method

Select the method to use for the request:

- DELETE
- GET
- HEAD
- OPTIONS
- PATCH
- POST
- PUT

### URL

Enter the endpoint you want to use.

### Authentication

n8n recommends using the **Predefined Credential Type** option when it's available. It offers an easier way to set up and manage credentials, compared to configuring generic credentials.

#### Predefined credentials

Credentials for integrations supported by n8n, including both built-in and community nodes. Use **Predefined Credential Type** for custom operations without extra setup. Refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/custom-operations.md) for more information.

#### Generic credentials

Credentials for integrations not supported by n8n. You'll need to manually configure the authentication process, including specifying the required API endpoints, necessary parameters, and the authentication method. 

You can select one of the following methods:

* Basic auth
* Custom auth
* Digest auth
* Header auth
* OAuth1 API
* OAuth2 API
* Query auth

Refer to [HTTP request credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest.md) for more information on setting up each credential type.

### Send Query Parameters

Query parameters act as filters on HTTP requests. If the API you're interacting with supports them and the request you're making needs a filter, turn this option on.

**Specify your query parameters** using one of the available options:

* **Using Fields Below**: Enter **Name**/**Value** pairs of **Query Parameters**. To enter more query parameter name/value pairs, select **Add Parameter**. The name is the name of the field you're filtering on, and the value is the filter value.
* **Using JSON**: Enter **JSON** to define your query parameters.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

### Send Headers

Use this parameter to send headers with your request. Headers contain metadata or context about your request.

**Specify Headers** using one of the available options:

* **Using Fields Below**: Enter **Name**/**Value** pairs of **Header Parameters**. To enter more header parameter name/value pairs, select **Add Parameter**. The name is the header you wish to set, and the value is the value you want to pass for that header.
* **Using JSON**: Enter **JSON** to define your header parameters.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

## Node options

Select **Add Option** to view and select these options. Options are available to all parameters unless otherwise noted.

### Array Format in Query Parameters

/// note | Option availability
This option is only available when you turn on **Send Query Parameters**.
///

Use this option to control the format for arrays included in query parameters. Choose from these options:

* **No Brackets**: Arrays will format as the name=value for each item in the array, for example: `foo=bar&foo=qux`.
* **Brackets Only**: The node adds square brackets after each array name, for example: `foo[]=bar&foo[]=qux`.
* **Brackets with Indices**: The node adds square brackets with an index value after each array name, for example: `foo[0]=bar&foo[1]=qux`.

Refer to your service's API documentation for guidance on which option to use.

### Batching

Control how to batch large numbers of input items:

* **Items per Batch**: Enter the number of input items to include in each batch.
* **Batch Interval**: Enter the time to wait between each batch of requests in milliseconds. Enter 0 for no batch interval.

### Ignore SSL Issues

By default, n8n only downloads the response if SSL certificate validation succeeds. If you'd like to download the response even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn this option on.

### Lowercase Headers

Choose whether to lowercase header names (turned on, default) or not (turned off).

### Redirects

Choose whether to follow redirects (turned on by default) or not (turned off). If turned on, enter the maximum number of redirects the request should follow in **Max Redirects**.

### Response

Use this option to set some details about the expected API response, including:

* **Include Response Headers and Status**: By default, the node returns only the body. Turn this option on to return the full response (headers and response status code) as well as the body.
* **Never Error**: By default, the node returns success only when the response returns with a 2xx code. Turn this option on to return success regardless of the code returned.
* **Response Format**: Select the format in which the data gets returned. Choose from:
    * **Autodetect** (default): The node detects and formats the response based on the data returned.
    * **File**: Select this option to put the response into a file. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in **Put Output in Field**.
    * **JSON**: Select this option to format the response as JSON.
    * **Text**: Select this option to format the response as plain text. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in **Put Output in Field**.

### Pagination

Use this option to paginate results, useful for handling query results that are too big for the API to return in a single call.

/// note | Inspect the API data first
Some options for pagination require knowledge of the data returned by the API you're using. Before setting up pagination, either check the API documentation, or do an API call without pagination, to see the data it returns.
///
??? Details "Understand pagination"
    Pagination means splitting a large set of data into multiple pages. The amount of data on each page depends on the limit you set.
  
    For example, you make an API call to an endpoint called `/users`. The API wants to send back information on 300 users, but this is too much data for the API to send in one response. 
  
    If the API supports pagination, you can incrementally fetch the data. To do this, you call `/users` with a pagination limit, and a page number or URL to tell the API which page to send. In this example, say you use a limit of 10, and start from page 0. The API sends the first 10 users in its response. You then call the API again, increasing the page number by 1, to get the next 10 results.

Configure the pagination settings:

* **Pagination Mode**:
    * **Off**: Turn off pagination.
    * **Update a Parameter in Each Request**: Use this when you need to dynamically set parameters for each request.
    * **Response Contains Next URL**: Use this when the API response includes the URL of the next page. Use an expression to set **Next URL**.

For example setups, refer to [HTTP Request node cookbook | Pagination](/code/cookbook/http-node/pagination.md).

n8n provides built-in variables for working with HTTP node requests and responses when using pagination:

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/http/pagination-variables.md"

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/http/pagination-api-differences.md"

### Proxy

Use this option if you need to specify an HTTP proxy.

Enter the **Proxy** the request should use.

### Timeout

Use this option to set how long the node should wait for the server to send response headers (and start the response body). The node aborts requests that exceed this value for the initial response.

Enter the **Timeout** time to wait in milliseconds.

## Tool-only options

The following options are only available when attached to an [AI agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent.md) as a [tool](/advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools.md){ data-preview }.

### Optimize Response

Whether to optimize the tool response to reduce the amount of data passed to the LLM. Optimizing the response can reduce costs and can help the LLM ignore unimportant details, often leading to better results.

When optimizing responses, you select an expected response type, which determines other options you can configure. The supported response types are:

#### JSON

When expecting a **JSON** response, you can configure which parts of the JSON data to use as a response with the following choices:

* **Field Containing Data**: This field identifies a specific part of the JSON object that contains your relevant data. You can leave this blank to use the entire response.
* **Include Fields**: This is how you choose which fields you want in your response object. There are three choices:
	* **All**: Include all fields in the response object.
	* **Selected**: Include only the fields specified below.
		* **Fields**: A comma-separated list of fields to include in the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.
	* **Exclude**: Include all fields *except* the fields specified below.
		* **Fields**: A comma-separated list of fields to exclude from the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.

#### HTML

When expecting **HTML**, you can identify the part of an HTML document relevant to the LLM and optimize the response with the following options:

* **Selector (CSS)**: A specific element or element type to include in the response HTML. Uses the `body` element by default.
* **Return Only Content**: Whether to strip HTML tags and attributes from the response, leaving only the actual content. This uses fewer tokens and may be easier for the model to understand.
	* **Elements To Omit**: A comma-separated list of CSS selectors to exclude when extracting content.
* **Truncate Response**: Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.
	* **Max Response Characters**: The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000.

#### Text

When expecting a generic **Text** response, you can optimize the results with the following options:

* **Truncate Response**: Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.
	* **Max Response Characters**: The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000.

## Import curl command

[curl](https://curl.se/){:target=_blank .external-link} is a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs.

You can use curl to call REST APIs. If the API documentation of the service you want to use provides curl examples, you can copy them out of the documentation and into n8n to configure the HTTP Request node.

Import a curl command:

1. From the HTTP Request node's **Parameters** tab, select **Import cURL**. The **Import cURL command** modal opens.
2. Paste your curl command into the text box.
3. Select **Import**. n8n loads the request configuration into the node fields. This overwrites any existing configuration.

# Local File Trigger node

The Local File Trigger node starts a workflow when it detects changes on the file system. These changes involve a file or folder getting added, changed, or deleted.

/// note | Self-hosted n8n only
This node isn't available on n8n Cloud.
///

## Node parameters

You can choose what event to watch for using the **Trigger On** parameter.

## Changes to a Specific File

The node triggers when the specified file changes.

Enter the path for the file to watch in **File to Watch**.

## Changes Involving a Specific Folder

The node triggers when a change occurs in the selected folder.

Configure these parameters:

- **Folder to Watch**: Enter the path of the folder to watch.
- **Watch for**: Select the type of change to watch for.


## Node options

Use the node **Options** to include or exclude files and folders.

- **Include Linked Files/Folders**: also watch for changes to linked files or folders.
- **Ignore**: files or paths to ignore. n8n tests the whole path, not just the filename. Supports the [Anymatch](https://github.com/micromatch/anymatch){:target=_blank .external-link} syntax.
- **Max Folder Depth**: how deep into the folder structure to watch for changes.

### Examples for Ignore

Ignore a single file:

```sh
**/<fileName>.<suffix>
# For example, **/myfile.txt
```

Ignore a sub-directory of a directory you're watching:

```sh
**/<directoryName>/**
# For example, **/myDirectory/**
```

# Manual Trigger node

Use this node if you want to start a workflow by selecting **Test Workflow** and don't want any option for the workflow to run automatically.

Workflows always need a trigger, or start point. Most workflows start with a trigger node firing in response to an external event or the [Schedule Trigger](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/index.md) firing on a set schedule.

The Manual Trigger node serves as the workflow trigger for workflows that don't have an automatic trigger.

Use this trigger:

* To test your workflow before you add an automatic trigger of some kind.
* When you don't want the workflow to run automatically.

## Common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the Manual Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

<!-- vale off -->
### Only one 'Manual Trigger' node is allowed in a workflow
<!-- vale on -->

This error displays if you try to add a Manual Trigger node to a workflow which already includes a Manual Trigger node.

Remove your existing Manual Trigger or edit your workflow to connect that trigger to a different node.

# Merge

Use the Merge node to combine data from multiple streams, once data of all streams is available.

/// note | Major changes in 0.194.0
The n8n team overhauled this node in n8n 0.194.0. This document reflects the latest version of the node. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can find the previous version of this document [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/4ff688642cc9ee7ca7d00987847bf4e4515da59d/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge.md){:target=_blank .external-link}.
///

/// note | Minor changes in 1.49.0
n8n version 1.49.0 introduced the option to add more than two inputs. Older versions only support up to two inputs. If you're running an older version and want to combine multiple inputs in these versions, use the [Code node](https://deploy-preview-2225--n8n-docs.netlify.app/code/code-node/).

The **Mode > SQL Query** feature was also added in n8n version 1.49.0 and isn't available in older versions.
///

## Node parameters

You can specify how the Merge node should combine data from different data streams by choosing a **Mode**: 

### Append

Keep data from all inputs. Choose a **Number of Inputs** to output items of each input, one after another. The node waits for the execution of all connected inputs. 

<figure markdown="span">
![Sample Append mode inputs and output. Two separate data sources are on the left, one with items A, B, C and one with items D, E, F. The final data source combines both and lists A, B, C, D, E, F.](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/append-diagram.png)
<figcaption>Append mode inputs and output</figcaption>
</figure>

### Combine

Combine data from two inputs. Select an option in **Combine By** to determine how you want to merge the input data.

#### Matching Fields

Compare items by field values. Enter the fields you want to compare in **Fields to Match**. 

n8n's default behavior is to keep matching items. You can change this using the **Output Type** setting:

* **Keep Matches**: Merge items that match. This is like an inner join.
* **Keep Non-Matches**: Merge items that don't match.
* **Keep Everything**: Merge items together that do match and include items that don't match. This is like an outer join.
* **Enrich Input 1**: Keep all data from Input 1, and add matching data from Input 2. This is like a left join.
* **Enrich Input 2**: Keep all data from Input 2, and add matching data from Input 1. This is like a right join.

<figure markdown="span">
![Sample Combine mode inputs and output. Two separate data sources are on the left. The final data source combines these data sources by matching fields.](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/merge-by-field-diagram.png)
<figcaption>Combine by Matching Fields mode inputs and output</figcaption>
</figure>


#### Position

Combine items based on their order. The item at index 0 in Input 1 merges with the item at index 0 in Input 2, and so on.

<figure markdown="span">
![Sample Combine mode inputs and output. Two separate data sources are on the left. The final data source combines these data sources by index position.](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/merge-by-position-diagram.png)
<figcaption>Combine by Position mode inputs and output</figcaption>
</figure>


#### All Possible Combinations

Output all possible item combinations, while merging fields with the same name.

<figure markdown="span">
![Sample Combine mode inputs and output. Two separate data sources are on the left. The final data source combines these data sources by all possible combinations.](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/multiplex-diagram.png)
<figcaption>Combine by All Possible Combinations mode inputs and output</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Combine mode options

When merging data by **Mode > Combine**, you can set these **Options**:

* **Clash Handling**: Choose how to merge when data streams clash, or when there are sub-fields. Refer to [Clash handling](#clash-handling) for details.
* **Fuzzy Compare**: Whether to tolerate type differences when comparing fields (enabled), or not (disabled, default). For example, when you enable this, n8n treats `"3"` and `3` as the same.
* **Disable Dot Notation**: This prevents accessing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name.
* **Multiple Matches**: Choose how n8n handles multiple matches when comparing data streams.
    * **Include All Matches**: Output multiple items if there are multiple matches, one for each match.
    * **Include First Match Only**: Keep the first item per match and discard the remaining multiple matches.
* **Include Any Unpaired Items**: Choose whether to keep or discard unpaired items when merging by position. The default behavior is to leave out the items without a match. 

##### Clash Handling

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/field-value-clash.md"

### SQL Query

Write a custom SQL Query to merge the data. 

Example: 
```sql
SELECT * FROM input1 LEFT JOIN input2 ON input1.name = input2.id
```

Data from previous nodes are available as tables and you can use them in the SQL query as input1, input2, input3, and so on, based on their order. Refer to [AlaSQL GitHub page](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/Supported-SQL-statements){:target=_blank .external-link} for a full list of supported SQL statements. 

### Choose Branch

Choose which input to keep. This option always waits until the data from both inputs is available. You can choose to **Output**:

* The **Input 1 Data**
* The **Input 2 Data**
* **A Single, Empty Item**

The node outputs the data from the chosen input, without changing it.

## Templates and examples

<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->
[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'merge') ]]

## Merging data streams with uneven numbers of items

The items passed into Input 1 of the Merge node will take precedence. For example, if the Merge node receives five items in Input 1 and 10 items in Input 2, it only processes five items. The remaining five items from Input 2 aren't processed.

## Branch execution with If and Merge nodes

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/if-merge-branch-execution.md"


## Try it out: A step by step example

Create a workflow with some example input data to try out the Merge node.

### Set up sample data using the Code nodes

1. Add a Code node to the canvas and connect it to the Start node.
2. Paste the following JavaScript code snippet in the **JavaScript Code** field:
```js
return [
  {
    json: {
      name: 'Stefan',
      language: 'de',
    }
  },
  {
    json: {
      name: 'Jim',
      language: 'en',
    }
  },
  {
    json: {
      name: 'Hans',
      language: 'de',
    }
  }
];
```
3. Add a second Code node, and connect it to the Start node.
4. Paste the following JavaScript code snippet in the **JavaScript Code** field:
```js
return [
	  {
    json: {
      greeting: 'Hello',
      language: 'en',
    }
  },
  {
    json: {
      greeting: 'Hallo',
      language: 'de',
    }
  }
];
```

### Try out different merge modes

Add the Merge node. Connect the first Code node to **Input 1**, and the second Code node to **Input 2**. Run the workflow to load data into the Merge node.

The final workflow should look like this:

[[ workflowDemo("https://api.n8n.io/workflows/templates/655") ]]

Now try different options in **Mode** to see how it affects the output data.

#### Append

Select **Mode** > **Append**, then select **Execute step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:
<!-- vale off -->
| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stefan | de |  |
| Jim | en |  |
| Hans | de |  |
|   | en | Hello |
|   | de | Hallo |
<!-- vale on -->

#### Combine by Matching Fields

You can merge these two data inputs so that each person gets the correct greeting for their language.

1. Select **Mode** > **Combine**.
2. Select **Combine by** > **Matching Fields**.
3. In both **Input 1 Field** and **Input 2 Field**, enter `language`. This tells n8n to combine the data by matching the values in the `language` field in each data set.
4. Select **Execute step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:
<!-- vale off -->

| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stefan | de | Hallo |
| Jim | en | Hello  |
| Hans | de | Hallo |
<!-- vale on -->

#### Combine by Position

Select **Mode** > **Combine**, **Combine by** > **Position**, then select **Execute step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:
<!-- vale off -->
| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stefan | en | Hello |
| Jim | de | Hallo  |
<!-- vale on -->

##### Keep unpaired items

If you want to keep all items, select **Add Option** > **Include Any Unpaired Items**, then turn on **Include Any Unpaired Items**.

Your output in table view should look like this:
<!-- vale off -->
| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stefan | en | Hello |
| Jim | de | Hallo  |
| Hans | de |  |
<!-- vale on -->

#### Combine by All Possible Combinations 

Select **Mode** > **Combine**, **Combine by** > **All Possible Combinations**, then select **Execute step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:
<!-- vale off -->
| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stefan | en | Hello |
| Stefan | de | Hallo |
| Jim | en | Hello  |
| Jim | de | Hallo |
| Hans | en | Hello |
| Hans | de | Hallo |
<!-- vale on -->

# Read/Write Files from Disk

Use the Read/Write Files from Disk node to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running.

/// note | Self-hosted n8n only
This node isn't available on n8n Cloud.
///

## Operations

- [**Read File(s) From Disk**](#read-files-from-disk): Use this operation to retrieve one or more files from the computer that runs n8n.
- [**Write File to Disk**](#write-file-to-disk): Use this operation to create a binary file on the computer that runs n8n.

Refer to the sections below for more information on configuring the node for each operation.

## Read File(s) From Disk

Configure this operation with these parameters:

* **File(s) Selector**: Enter the path of the file you want to read.
	- To enter multiple files, enter a page path pattern. You can use these characters to define a path pattern:
		- `*`: Matches any character zero or more times, excluding path separators.
		- `**`: Matches any character zero or more times, include path separators.
		- `?`: Matches any character except for path separators one time.
		- `[]`: Matches any characters inside the brackets. For example, `[abc]` would match the characters `a`, `b`, or `c`, and nothing else.

Refer to [Picomatch's Basic globbing](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch#basic-globbing){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information on these characters and their expected behavior.

### Read File(s) From Disk options

You can also configure this operation with these **Options**:

* **File Extension**: Enter the extension for the file in the node output.
* **File Name**: Enter the name for the file in the node output.
* **MIME Type**: Enter the file's MIME type in the node output. Refer to [Common MIME types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types){:target=_blank .external-link} for a list of file extensions and their MIME types.
* **Put Output File in Field**: Enter the name of the field in the output data to contain the file.

## Write File to Disk

Configure this operation with these parameters:

* **File Path and Name**: Enter the destination for the file, the file's name, and the file's extension.
* **Input Binary Field**: Enter the name of the field in the node input data that will contain the binary file.

### Write File to Disk options

You can also configure this operation with these **Options**:

This operation includes a single option, whether to **Append** data to an existing file instead of creating a new one (turned on) or to create a new file instead of appending to existing (turned off).

## Templates and examples

<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->
[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'readwrite-files-from-disk') ]]

## File locations

If you run n8n in Docker, your command runs in the n8n container and not the Docker host.

This node looks for files relative to the n8n install path. n8n recommends using absolute file paths to prevent any errors.

# Remove Duplicates node

Use the Remove Duplicates node to identify and delete items that are:

* identical across all fields or a subset of fields in a single execution
* identical to or surpassed by items seen in previous executions

This is helpful in situations where you can end up with duplicate data, such as a user creating multiple accounts, or a customer submitting the same order multiple times. When working with large datasets it becomes more difficult to spot and remove these items.

By comparing against data from previous executions, the Remove Duplicates node can  delete items seen in earlier executions. It can also ensure that new items have a later date or a higher value than previous values.

/// note | Major changes in 1.64.0
The n8n team overhauled this node in n8n 1.64.0. This document reflects the latest version of the node. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can find the previous version of this document [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/7a66308290e6e5b104fcb82a3beafa0d6987df36/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates.md){:target=_blank .external-link}.
///

## Operation modes

The remove duplication node works differently depending on the value of the **operation** parameter:

* **[Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input](#remove-items-repeated-within-current-input)**: Identify and remove duplicate items in the current input across all fields or a subset of fields.
* **[Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions](#remove-items-processed-in-previous-executions)**: Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates.
* **[Clear Deduplication History](#clear-deduplication-history)**: Wipe the memory of items from previous executions.

### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input

When you set the "Operations" field to **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input**, the Remove Duplicate node identifies and removes duplicate items in the current input. It can do this across all fields, or within a subset of fields.

#### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input parameters

When using the **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input** operation, the following parameter is available:

* **Compare**: Select which fields of the input data n8n should compare to check if they're the same. The following options are available:
	* **All Fields**: Compares all fields of the input data.
	* **All Fields Except**: Enter which input data fields n8n should exclude from the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.
	* **Selected Fields**: Enter which input data fields n8n should include in the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.

#### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input options

If you choose **All Fields Except** or **Selected Fields** as your compare type, you can add these options:

* **Disable Dot Notation**: Set whether to use dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child` (turned off) or not (turn on).
* **Remove Other Fields**: Set whether to remove any fields that aren't used in the comparison (turned on) or not (turned off).

### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions

When you set the "Operation" field to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions**, the Remove Duplicate node compares items in the current input to items from previous executions.

#### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions parameters

When using the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation, the following parameters are available:

* **Keep Items Where**: Select how n8n decides which items to keep. The following options are available:
	* **Value Is New**: n8n removes items if their value matches items from earlier executions.
	* **Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value**: n8n removes items if the current value isn't higher than previous values.
	* **Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date**: n8n removes date items if the current date isn't later than previous dates.

* **Value to Dedupe On**: The input field or fields to compare. The option you select for the **Keep Items Where** parameter determines the exact format you need:
	* When using **Value Is New**, this must be an input field or combination of fields with a unique ID.
	* When using **Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value**, this must be an input field or combination of fields that has an incremental value.
	* When using **Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date**, this must be an input field that has a date value in ISO format.

#### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions options

When using the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation, the following option is available:

* **Scope**: Sets how n8n stores and uses the deduplication data for comparisons. The following options are available:
	* **Node**: (default) Stores the data for this node independently from other Remove Duplicates instances in the workflow. When you use this scope, you can [clear the duplication history](#clear-deduplication-history) for this node instance without affecting other nodes.
	* **Workflow**: Stores the duplication data at the workflow level. This shares duplication data with any other Remove Duplicate nodes set to use "workflow" scope.  n8n will still manage the duplication data for other Remove Duplicate nodes set to "node" scope independently.

When you select **Value Is New** as your **Keep Items Where** choice, this option is also available:

* **History Size**: The number of items for n8n to store to track duplicates across executions. The value of the **Scope** option determines whether this history size is specific to this individual Remove Duplicate node instance or shared with other instances in the workflow. By default, n8n stores 10,000 items.

### Clear Deduplication History

When you set the "Operation" field to **Clear Deduplication History**, the Remove Duplicates node manages and clears the stored items from previous executions. This operation doesn't affect any items in the current input. Instead, it manages the database of items that the "Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions" operation uses.

#### Clear Deduplication History parameters

When using the **Clear Deduplication History** operation, the following parameter is available:

* **Mode**: How you want to manage the key / value items stored in the database. The following option is available:
	* **Clean Database**: Deletes all duplication data stored in the database. This resets the duplication database to its original state.

#### Clear Deduplication History options

When using the **Clear Deduplication History** operation, the following option is available:

* **Scope**: Sets the scope n8n uses when managing the duplication database.
	* **Node**: (default) Manages the duplication database specific to this Remove Duplicates node instance.
	* **Workflow**: Manages the duplication database shared by all Remove Duplicate node instances that use workflow scope.

## Set up sample data using the Code node

Create a workflow with some example input data to try out the Remove Duplicates node.

1. Add a Code node to the canvas and connect it to the Manual Trigger node.
2. In the Code node, set **Mode** to **Run Once for Each Item** and **Language** to **JavaScript**.
3. Paste the following JavaScript code snippet in the **JavaScript** field:
```js
let data =[];

return {
  data: [
    { id: 1, name: 'Taylor Swift', job: 'Pop star', last_updated: '2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Ed Sheeran', job: 'Singer-songwriter', last_updated: '2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z' },
    { id: 3, name: 'Adele', job: 'Singer-songwriter', last_updated: '2024-10-07T14:15:59.493Z' },
    { id: 4, name: 'Bruno Mars', job: 'Singer-songwriter', last_updated: '2024-08-25T17:45:12.493Z' },
    { id: 1, name: 'Taylor Swift', job: 'Pop star', last_updated: '2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z' },  // duplicate
    { id: 5, name: 'Billie Eilish', job: 'Singer-songwriter', last_updated: '2024-09-10T09:30:12.493Z' },
    { id: 6, name: 'Katy Perry', job: 'Pop star', last_updated: '2024-10-08T12:30:45.493Z' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Ed Sheeran', job: 'Singer-songwriter', last_updated: '2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z' },  // duplicate
    { id: 7, name: 'Lady Gaga', job: 'Pop star', last_updated: '2024-09-15T14:45:30.493Z' },
    { id: 8, name: 'Rihanna', job: 'Pop star', last_updated: '2024-10-01T11:50:22.493Z' },
    { id: 3, name: 'Adele', job: 'Singer-songwriter', last_updated: '2024-10-07T14:15:59.493Z' },  // duplicate
    //{ id: 9, name: 'Tom Hanks', job: 'Actor', last_updated: '2024-10-17T13:58:31.493Z' },
    //{ id: 0, name: 'Madonna', job: 'Pop star', last_updated: '2024-10-17T17:11:38.493Z' },
    //{ id: 15, name: 'Bob Dylan', job: 'Folk singer', last_updated: '2024-09-24T08:03:16.493Z'},
    //{ id: 10, name: 'Harry Nilsson', job: 'Singer-songwriter', last_updated: '2020-10-17T17:11:38.493Z' },
    //{ id: 11, name: 'Kylie Minogue', job: 'Pop star', last_updated: '2024-10-24T08:03:16.493Z'},
  ]
}
```
4. Add a Split Out node to the canvas and connect it to the Code node.
5. In the Split Out node, enter `data` in the **Fields To Split Out** field.

## Removing duplicates from the current input

1. Add a Remove Duplicates node to the canvas and connect it to the Split Out node. Choose **Remove items repeated within current input** as the **Action** to start.
2. Open the Remove Duplicates node and ensure that the **Operation** is set to **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input**.
3. Choose **All fields** in the **Compare** field.
4. Select **Execute step** to run the Remove Duplicates node, removing duplicated data in the current input.

n8n removes the items that have the same data across all fields. Your output in table view should look like this:

<!-- vale off -->
| **id** | **name**      | **job**           | **last_updated**         |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| 1      | Taylor Swift  | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |
| 2      | Ed Sheeran    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z |
| 3      | Adele         | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-07T14:15:59.493Z |
| 4      | Bruno Mars    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-08-25T17:45:12.493Z |
| 5      | Billie Eilish | Singer-songwriter | 2024-09-10T09:30:12.493Z |

| 7      | Lady Gaga     | Pop star          | 2024-09-15T14:45:30.493Z |
| 8      | Rihanna       | Pop star          | 2024-10-01T11:50:22.493Z |
<!-- vale on -->

5. Open the Remove Duplicates node again and change the **Compare** parameter to **Selected Fields**.
6. In the **Fields To Compare** field, enter `job`.
7. Select **Execute step** to run the Remove Duplicates node, removing duplicated data in the current input.

n8n removes the items in the current input that have the same `job` data. Your output in table view should look like this:

<!-- vale off -->
| **id** | **name**      | **job**           | **last_updated**         |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| 1      | Taylor Swift  | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |
| 2      | Ed Sheeran    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z |
<!-- vale on -->

## Keep items where the value is new

1. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions**.
2. Set the **Keep Items Where** parameter to **Value Is New**.
3. Set the **Value to Dedupe On** parameter to `{{ $json.name }}`.
4. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** to run the workflow. Open the Remove Duplicates node to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. Since this is the first time running the Remove Duplicates node with this operation, n8n processes all data items and places them into the **Kept** output tab. The order of the items may be different than the order in the input data:

<!-- vale off -->
| **id** | **name**      | **job**           | **last_updated**         |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| 1      | Taylor Swift  | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |

<!-- vale on -->

/// note | Items are only compared against previous executions
The current input items are only compared against the stored items from previous executions. This means that items repeated within the current input aren't removed in this mode of operation. If you need to remove duplicate items within the current input *and* across executions, connect two Remove Duplicate nodes together sequentially. Set the first to use the **Remove Items Repated Within Current Input** operation and the second to use the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation.
///

5. Open the Code node and uncomment (remove the `//` from) the line for "Tom Hanks."
6. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** again. Open the Remove Duplicates node again to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. This time, the **Kept** tab contains the one new record from the Code node:

<!-- vale off -->
| **id** | **name**  | **job** | **last_updated**         |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------------------------|
| 9      | Tom Hanks | Actor   | 2024-10-17T13:58:31.493Z |
<!-- vale on -->

The **Discarded** tab contains the items processed by the previous execution:

<!-- vale off -->
| **id** | **name**      | **job**           | **last_updated**         |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|

| 8      | Rihanna       | Pop star          | 2024-10-01T11:50:22.493Z |
<!-- vale on -->

Before continuing, clear the duplication history to get ready for the next example:

7. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Clear Deduplication History**.
8. Select **Execute step** to clear the current duplication history.

## Keep items where the value is higher than any previous value

1. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions**.
2. Set the **Keep Items Where** parameter to **Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value**.
3. Set the **Value to Dedupe On** parameter to `{{ $json.id }}`.
4. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** to run the workflow. Open the Remove Duplicates node to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. Since this is the first time running the Remove Duplicates node after clearing the history, n8n processes all data items and places them into the **Kept** output tab. The order of the items may be different than the order in the input data:

<!-- vale off -->
| **id** | **name**      | **job**           | **last_updated**         |

<!-- vale on -->

5. Open the Code node and uncomment (remove the `//` from) the lines for "Madonna" and "Bob Dylan."
6. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** again. Open the Remove Duplicates node again to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. This time, the **Kept** tab contains a single entry for "Bob Dylan." n8n keeps this item because its `id` column value (15) is higher than any previous values (the previous maximum value was 9):

<!-- vale off -->
| **id** | **name**  | **job**     | **last_updated**         |
|--------|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| 15     | Bob Dylan | Folk singer | 2024-09-24T08:03:16.493Z |
<!-- vale on -->

The **Discarded** tab contains the 13 items with an `id` column value equal to or less than the previous maximum value (9). Even though it's new, this table includes the entry for "Madonna" because its `id` value isn't larger than the previous maximum value:

<!-- vale off -->
| **id** | **name**      | **job**           | **last_updated**         |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|

Before continuing, clear the duplication history to get ready for the next example:

7. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Clear Deduplication History**.
8. Select **Execute step** to clear the current duplication history.

## Keep items where the value is a date later than any previous date

1. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions**.
2. Set the **Keep Items Where** parameter to **Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date**.
3. Set the **Value to Dedupe On** parameter to `{{ $json.last_updated }}`.
4. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** to run the workflow. Open the Remove Duplicates node to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. Since this is the first time running the Remove Duplicates node after clearing the history, n8n processes all data items and places them into the **Kept** output tab.

# Rename Keys

Use the Rename Keys node to rename the keys of a key-value pair in n8n.

## Node parameters

You can rename one or multiple keys using the Rename Keys node. Select the **Add new key** button to rename a key.

For each key, enter the:

- **Current Key Name**: The current name of the key you want to rename.
- **New Key Name**: The new name you want to assign to the key.

## Node options

Choose whether to use a **Regex** regular expression to identify keys to rename. To use this option, you must also enter:

* The **Regular Expression** you'd like to use.
* **Replace With**: Enter the new name you want to assign to the key(s) that match the **Regular Expression**.
* You can also choose these Regex-specific options:
    * **Case Insensitive**: Set whether the regular expression should match case (turned off) or be case insensitive (turned on).
    * **Max Depth**: Enter the maximum depth to replace keys, using `-1` for unlimited and `0` for top-level only.

# Respond to Webhook

Use the Respond to Webhook node to control the response to incoming webhooks. This node works with the [Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/index.md) node.

/// note | Runs once for the first data item
The Respond to Webhook node runs once, using the first incoming data item. Refer to [Return more than one data item](#return-more-than-one-data-item-deprecated) for more information.
///

## How to use Respond to Webhook

To use the Respond to Webhook node:

1. Add a [Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/index.md) node as the trigger node for the workflow.
1. In the Webhook node, set **Respond** to **Using 'Respond to Webhook' node**.
1. Add the Respond to Webhook node anywhere in your workflow. If you want it to return data from other nodes, place it after those nodes.

## Node parameters

Configure the node behavior using these parameters.

### Respond With

Choose what data to send in the webhook response.

- **All Incoming Items**: Respond with all the JSON items from the input.
- **Binary**: Respond with a binary file defined in **Response Data Source**.
- **First Incoming Item**: Respond with the first incoming item's JSON.
- **JSON**: Respond with a JSON object defined in **Response Body**.
- **No Data**: No response payload.
- **Redirect**: Redirect to a URL set in **Redirect URL**.
- **Text**: Respond with text set in **Response Body**.

## Node options

Select **Add Option** to view and set the options.

- **Response Code**: Set the [response code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status){:target=_blank .external-link} to use.
- **Response Headers**: Define the response headers to send.
- **Put Response in Field**: Available when you respond with **All Incoming Items** or **First Incoming Item**. Set the field name for the field containing the response data.

## Templates and examples

<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->
[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'respond-to-webhook') ]]

## Workflow behavior

When using the Respond to Webhook node, workflows behave as follows:

- The workflow finishes without executing the Respond to Webhook node: it returns a standard message with a 200 status.
- The workflow errors before the first Respond to Webhook node executes: the workflow returns an error message with a 500 status.
- A second Respond to Webhook node executes after the first one: the workflow ignores it.
- A Respond to Webhook node executes but there was no webhook: the workflow ignores the Respond to Webhook node.

## Return more than one data item (deprecated)

/// note | Deprecated in 1.22.0
n8n 1.22.0 added support for returning all data items using the **All Incoming Items** option. n8n recommends upgrading to the latest version of n8n, instead of using the workarounds described in this section.
///

The Respond to Webhook node runs once, using the first incoming data item. This includes when using [expressions](/code/expressions.md). You can't force looping using the Loop node: the workflow will run, but the webhook response will still only contain the results of the first execution. 

If you need to return more than one data item, choose one of these options:

- Instead of using the Respond to Webhook node, use the **When Last Node Finishes** option in **Respond** in the Webhook node. Use this when you want to return the final data that the workflow outputs.
- Use the [Aggregate](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate.md) node to turn multiple items into a single item before passing the data to the Respond to Webhook node. Set **Aggregate** to **All Item Data (Into a Single List)**.

# Schedule Trigger node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Schedule Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Invalid cron expression

This error occurs when you set **Trigger Interval** to **Custom (Cron)** and n8n doesn't understand your cron expression. This may mean that there is a mistake in your cron expression or that you're using an incompatible syntax.

To debug, check that the following:

* That your cron expression follows the syntax used in the [cron examples](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/index.md#custom-cron-interval)
* That your cron expression (after removing the [seconds column](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/index.md#why-there-are-six-asterisks-in-the-cron-expression)) validates on [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/)

## Scheduled workflows run at the wrong time

If the Schedule Trigger node runs at the wrong time, it may mean that you need to adjust the time zone n8n uses.

### Adjust the timezone globally

If you're using [n8n Cloud](/manage-cloud/overview.md), follow the instructions on the [set the Cloud instance timezone](/manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone.md) page to ensure that n8n executes in sync with your local time.

If you're [self hosting](/hosting/index.md), set your global timezone using the [`GENERIC_TIMEZONE` environment variable](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization.md).

### Adjust the timezone for an individual workflow

To set the timezone for an individual workflow:

1. Open the workflow on the canvas.
1. Select the <span class="inline-image">![three dots menu](/_images/common-icons/three-dots-horizontal.png)</span> **Three dots icon** in the upper-right corner.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Change the **Timezone** setting.
1. Select **Save**.

### Variables not working as expected

While variables can be used in the scheduled trigger, their values only get evaluated when the workflow is activated. After activating the worfklow, you can alter a variable's value in the settings but it won't change how often the workflow runs. To work around this, you must stop and then re-activate the workflow to apply the updated variable value.

### Changing the trigger interval

You can update the scheduled trigger interval at any time but it only gets updated when the workflow is activated. If you change the trigger interval after the workflow is active, the changes won't take effect until you stop and then re-activate the workflow.

Also, the schedule begins from the time when you activate the workflow. For example, if you had originally set a schedule of every 1 hour and it should execute at 12:00, if you changed it to a 2 hour schedule and re-activated the workflow at 11:30, the next execution will be at 13:30, 2 hours from when you activated it.

# Schedule Trigger node

Use the Schedule Trigger node to run workflows at fixed intervals and times. This works in a similar way to the Cron software utility in Unix-like systems.

/// note | You must activate the workflow
If a workflow uses the Schedule node as a trigger, make sure that you save and activate the workflow. 
///

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/schedule/timezone-settings.md"

## Node parameters

Add **Trigger Rules** to determine when the trigger should run.

Use the **Trigger Interval** to select the time interval unit of measure to schedule the trigger for. All other parameters depend on the interval you select. Choose from:

- [Seconds trigger interval](#seconds-trigger-interval)
- [Minutes trigger interval](#minutes-trigger-interval)
- [Hours trigger interval](#hours-trigger-interval)
- [Days trigger interval](#days-trigger-interval)
- [Weeks trigger interval](#weeks-trigger-interval)
- [Months trigger interval](#months-trigger-interval)
- [Custom (Cron) interval](#custom-cron-interval)

You can add multiple **Trigger Rules** to run the node on different schedules.

Refer to the sections below for more detail on configuring each **Trigger Interval**. Refer to [Templates and examples](#templates-and-examples) for further examples.

### Seconds trigger interval

* **Seconds Between Triggers**: Enter the number of seconds between each workflow trigger. For example, if you enter `30` here, the trigger will run every 30 seconds.

### Minutes trigger interval

* **Minutes Between Triggers**: Enter the number of minutes between each workflow trigger. For example, if you enter `5` here, the trigger will run every 5 minutes.

### Hours trigger interval

* **Hours Between Triggers**: Enter the number of hours between each workflow trigger.
* **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `6` **Hours Between Triggers** and `30` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run every six hours at 30 minutes past the hour.

### Days trigger interval

* **Days Between Triggers**: Enter the number of days between each workflow trigger.
* **Trigger at Hour**: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
* **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

<!-- vale from-microsoft.AMPM = NO -->
For example, if you enter `2` **Days Between Triggers**, **9am** for **Trigger at Hour**, and `15` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run every two days at 9:15am.
<!-- vale from-microsoft.AMPM = YES -->

### Weeks trigger interval

* **Weeks Between Triggers**: Enter the number of weeks between each workflow trigger.
* **Trigger on Weekdays**: Select the day(s) of the week you want to trigger the node.
* **Trigger at Hour**: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
* **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `2` **Weeks Between Triggers**, **Monday** for **Trigger on Weekdays**, **3pm** for **Trigger at Hour**, and `30` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run every two weeks on Monday at 3:30 PM.

### Months trigger interval

* **Months Between Triggers**: Enter the number of months between each workflow trigger.
* **Trigger at Day of Month**: Enter the day of the month the day should trigger at, from `1` to `31`. If a month doesn't have this day, the node won't trigger. For example, if you enter `30` here, the node won't trigger in February.
* **Trigger at Hour**: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
* **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `3` **Months Between Triggers**, `28` **Trigger at Day of Month**, **9am** for **Trigger at Hour**, and `0` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run each quarter on the 28th day of the month at 9:00 AM.

### Custom (Cron) interval

Enter a custom cron **Expression** to set the schedule for the trigger.

To generate a Cron expression, you can use [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru){:target=_blank .external-link}. Paste the Cron expression that you generated using crontab guru in the **Expression** field in n8n.

#### Examples

<!-- vale from-write-good.Weasel = NO -->
|Type|Cron Expression|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Every X Seconds|`*/10 * * * * *`|Every 10 seconds.|
|Every X Minutes|`*/5 * * * *`|Every 5 minutes.|
|Hourly|`0 * * * *`|Every hour on the hour.|
|Daily|`0 6 * * *`|At 6:00 AM every day.|
|Weekly|`0 12 * * 1`|At noon every Monday.|
|Monthly|`0 0 1 * *`|At midnight on the 1st of every month.|
|Every X Days|`0 0 */3 * *`|At midnight every 3rd day.|
|Only Weekdays|`0 9 * * 1-5`|At 9:00 AM Monday through Friday.|
|Custom Hourly Range|`0 9-17 * * *`|Every hour from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day.|
|Quarterly|`0 0 1 1,4,7,10 *`|At midnight on the 1st of January, April, July, and October.|
<!-- vale from-write-good.Weasel = YES -->

/// warning | Using variables in the Cron expression
While variables can be used in the scheduled trigger, their values only get evaluated when the workflow is activated. If you alter a variable's value in the settings after a workflow is activated, the changes won't alter the cron schedule. To re-evaluate the variable, set the workflow to **Inactive** and then back to **Active** again
/// 

#### Why there are six asterisks in the Cron expression

The sixth asterisk in the Cron expression represents seconds. Setting this is optional. The node will execute even if you don't set the value for seconds.

* **Response Form Button Label**: The label for the button on the form to submit their response. The default choice is `Submit`.
* **Limit Wait Time**: Whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specified time limit. This can be an interval or a specific wall time.
* **Append n8n Attribution**: Set whether to include the phrase `This email was sent automatically with n8n` at the end of the email (turned on) or not (turned off).

### Custom Form parameters and options

When using the Custom Form response type, you build a form using the fields and options you want.

You can customize each form element with the settings outlined in the [n8n Form trigger's form elements](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger.md#form-elements). To add more fields, select the **Add Form Element** button.

The following options are also available:

* **Message Button Label**: The label to use for message button. The default choice is `Respond`.
* **Response Form Title**: The title of the form where users provide their response.
* **Response Form Description**: A description for the form where users provide their response.
* **Response Form Button Label**: The label for the button on the form to submit their response. The default choice is `Submit`.
* **Limit Wait Time**: Whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specified time limit. This can be an interval or a specific wall time.
* **Append n8n Attribution**: Set whether to include the phrase `This email was sent automatically with n8n` at the end of the email (turned on) or not (turned off).

# Edit Fields (Set)

Use the Edit Fields node to set workflow data. This node can set new data as well as overwrite data that already exists. This node is crucial in workflows which expect incoming data from previous nodes, such as when inserting values to Google Sheets or databases.

## Node parameters

These are the settings and options available in the Edit Fields node.

### Mode

You can either use **Manual Mapping** to edit fields using the GUI or **JSON Output** to write JSON that n8n adds to the input data.

### Fields to Set

If you select **Mode** > **Manual Mapping**, you can configure the fields by dragging and dropping values from **INPUT**.

The default behavior when you drag a value is:

* n8n sets the value's name as the field name.
* The field value contains an expression which accesses the value.

If you don't want to use expressions:

1. Hover over a field. n8n displays the **Fixed | Expressions** toggle. 
1. Select **Fixed**.

You can do this for both the name and value of the field.

![A gif showing the drag and drop action, as well as changing a field to fixed](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/set/drag-drop-fixed-toggle.gif)

### Keep Only Set Fields

Enable this to discard any input data that you don't use in **Fields to Set**.

### Include in Output

Choose which input data to include in the node's output data.

## Node options

Use these options to customize the behavior of the node.

### Include Binary Data

If the input data includes binary data, choose whether to include it in the Edit Fields node's output data.

### Ignore Type Conversion Errors

Manual Mapping only.

Enabling this allows n8n to ignore some data type errors when mapping fields.

### Support Dot Notation

By default, n8n supports dot notation.

For example, when using manual mapping, the node follows the dot notation for the **Name** field. That means if you set the name in the **Name** field as `number.one` and the value in the **Value** field as `20`, the resulting JSON is:

```json
{ "number": { "one": 20} }
```

You can prevent this behavior by selecting **Add Option** > **Support Dot Notation**, and setting the **Dot Notion** field to off. Now the resulting JSON is:

```json
{ "number.one": 20 }
```

[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'set') ]]

## Arrays and expressions in JSON Output mode

You can use arrays and expressions when creating your JSON Output.

For example, given this input data generated by the Customer Datastore node:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "23423532",
    "name": "Jay Gatsby",
    "email": "gatsby@west-egg.com",
    "notes": "Keeps asking about a green light??",
    "country": "US",
    "created": "1925-04-10"
  },
  {
    "id": "23423533",
    "name": "José Arcadio Buendía",
    "email": "jab@macondo.co",
    "notes": "Lots of people named after him. Very confusing",
    "country": "CO",
    "created": "1967-05-05"
  },
  {
    "id": "23423534",
    "name": "Max Sendak",
    "email": "info@in-and-out-of-weeks.org",
    "notes": "Keeps rolling his terrible eyes",
    "country": "US",
    "created": "1963-04-09"
  },
  {
    "id": "23423535",
    "name": "Zaphod Beeblebrox",
    "email": "captain@heartofgold.com",
    "notes": "Felt like I was talking to more than one person",
    "country": null,
    "created": "1979-10-12"
  },
  {
    "id": "23423536",
    "name": "Edmund Pevensie",

    "notes": "Passionate sailor",
    "country": "UK",
    "created": "1950-10-16"
  }
]
```

Add the following JSON in the **JSON Output** field, with **Include in Output** set to **All Input Fields**:

```json
{
  "newKey": "new value",
  "array": [{{ $json.id }},"{{ $json.name }}"],
  "object": {
    "innerKey1": "new value",
    "innerKey2": "{{ $json.id }}",
    "innerKey3": "{{ $json.name }}",
 }
}
```

You get this output:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "23423532",
    "name": "Jay Gatsby",
    "email": "gatsby@west-egg.com",

# Sort

Use the Sort node to organize lists of items in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.

/// note | Array sort behavior
The Sort operation uses the default JavaScript operation where the elements to be sorted are converted into strings and their values compared. Refer to [Mozilla's guide to Array sort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort){:target=_blank .external-link} to learn more.
///

## Node parameters

Configure this node using the **Type** parameter.

Use the dropdown to select how you want to input the sorting from these options.

### Simple

Performs an ascending or descending sort using the selected fields.

When you select this **Type**:

* Use the **Add Field To Sort By** button to input the **Field Name**.
* Select whether to use **Ascending** or **Descending** order.

#### Simple options

When you select **Simple** as the **Type**, you have the option to **Disable Dot Notation**. By default, n8n enables dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child`. Use this option to disable dot notation (turned on) or to continue using dot (turned off).

### Random

Creates a random order in the list.

### Code

Input custom JavaScript code to perform the sort operation. This is a good option if a simple sort won't meet your needs.

Enter your custom JavaScript code in the **Code** input field.

title: Loop Over Items (Split in Batches)
description: Documentation for the Loop Over Items node in n8n, a workflow automation platform. Includes guidance on usage, and links to examples.
contentType: [integration, reference]
priority: critical

# Loop Over Items

The Loop Over Items node helps you loop through data when needed.

The node saves the original incoming data, and with each iteration, returns a predefined amount of data through the **loop** output.

When the node execution completes, it combines all of the processed data and returns it through the **done** output.

## When to use the Loop Over Items node

By default, n8n nodes are designed to process a list of input items (with some exceptions, detailed below). Depending on what you're trying to achieve, you often don't need the Loop Over Items node in your workflow. You can learn more about how n8n processes multiple items on the [looping in n8n](/flow-logic/looping.md) page.

These links highlight some of the cases where the Loop Over Items node can be useful:

* [Loop until all items are processed](/flow-logic/looping.md#loop-until-all-items-are-processed): describes how the Loop Over Items node differs from normal item processing and when you might want to incorporate this node.
* [Node exceptions](/flow-logic/looping.md#node-exceptions): outlines specific cases and nodes where you may need to use the Loop Over Items node to manually build looping logic.
* [Avoiding rate limiting](/integrations/builtin/rate-limits.md): demonstrates how to batch API requests to avoid rate limits from other services.

## Node parameters

### Batch Size

Enter the number of items to return with each call.

## Node options

### Reset

If turned on, the node will reset with the current input-data newly initialized with each loop. Use this when you want the Loop Over Items node to treat incoming data as a new set of data instead of a continuation of previous items.

For example, you can use the Loop Over Items node with the reset option and an [If node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if.md) to query a paginated service when you don't know how many pages you need in advance. The loop queries pages one at a time, performs any processing, and increments the page number. The loop reset ensures the loop recognizes each iteration as a new set of data. The If node evaluates an exit condition to decide whether to perform another iteration or not.

/// warning | Include a valid termination condition
For workflows like the example described above, it's critical to include a valid termination condition for the loop. If your termination condition never matches, your workflow execution will get stuck in an infinite loop.
///

When enabled, you can adjust the reset conditions by switching the parameter representation from **Fixed** to **Expression**. The results of your expression evaluation determine when the node will reset item processing.

## Templates and examples

### Read RSS feed from two different sources

This workflow allows you to read an RSS feed from two different sources using the Loop Over Items node. You need the Loop Over Items node in the workflow as the RSS Feed Read node only processes the first item it receives. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/687-read-rss-feed-from-two-different-sources/){:target=_blank .external-link} on n8n.io.

The example walks through building the workflow, but assumes you are already familiar with n8n. To build your first workflow, including learning how to add nodes to a workflow, refer to [Try it out](/try-it-out/index.md).

The final workflow looks like this:

[[ workflowDemo("file:///integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/rss-feed-example.json") ]]

Copy the workflow file above and paste into your instance, or manually build it by following these steps:

1. Add the manual trigger.
2. Add the Code node.
3. Copy this code into the Code node:
	```js
	return [
		{
			json: {
				url: 'https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io',
			}
		},
		{
			json: {
				url: 'https://dev.to/feed/n8n',
			}
		}
	];
	```
4. Add the Loop Over Items node.
5. Configure Loop Over Items: set the batch size to `1` in the **Batch Size** field.
6. Add the RSS Feed Read node.
7. Select **Test Workflow**. This runs the workflow to load data into the RSS Feed Read node.
8. Configure RSS Feed Read: map `url` from the input to the **URL** field. You can do this by dragging and dropping from the **INPUT** panel, or using this expression: `{{ $json.url }}`.
9. Select **Test Workflow** to run the workflow and see the resulting data.

### Check that the node has processed all items

To check if the node still has items to process, use the following expression: `{{$node["Loop Over Items"].context["noItemsLeft"]}}`. This expression returns a boolean value. If the node still has data to process, the expression returns `false`, otherwise it returns `true`.

### Get the current running index of the node

To get the current running index of the node, use the following expression: `{{$node["Loop Over Items"].context["currentRunIndex"];}}`.

# Split Out

Use the Split Out node to separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items. For example, a list of customers, and you want to split them so that you have an item for each customer.

## Node parameters

Configure this node using the following parameters.

### Field to Split Out

Enter the field containing the list you want to separate out into individual items.

If you're working with binary data inputs, use `$binary` in an expression to set the field to split out.

### Include

Select whether and how you want n8n to keep any other fields from the input data with each new individual item.

You can select:

* **No Other Fields**: No other fields will be included.
* **All Other Fields**: All other fields will be included.
* **Selected Other Fields**: Only the selected fields will be included.
    * **Fields to Include**: Enter a comma separated list of the fields you want to include.

## Node options

### Disable Dot Notation

By default, n8n enables dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child`. Use this option to disable dot notation (turned on) or to continue using dot (turned off).

### Destination Field Name

Enter the field in the output where the split field contents should go.

### Include Binary

Choose whether to include binary data from the input in the new output (turned on) or not (turned off).

# Summarize

Use the Summarize node to aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.

## Node parameters

### Fields to Summarize

Use these fields to define how you want to summarize your input data.

* **Aggregation**: Select the aggregation method to use on a given field. Options include:
	* **Append**: Append 
		* If you select this option, decide whether you want to **Include Empty Values** or not.
	* **Average**: Calculate the numeric average of your input data.
	* **Concatenate**: Combine together values in your input data.
		* If you select this option, decide whether you want to **Include Empty Values** or not.
		* **Separator**: Select the separator you want to insert between concatenated values.
	* **Count**: Count the total number of values in your input data.
	* **Count Unique**: Count the number of unique values in your input data.
	* **Max**: Find the highest numeric value in your input data.
	* **Min**: Find the lowest numeric value in your input data.
	* **Sum**: Add together the numeric values in your input data.
* **Field**: Enter the name of the field you want to perform the aggregation on.

### Fields to Split By

Enter the name of the input fields that you want to split the summary by (similar to a group by statement). This allows you to get separate summaries based on values in other fields.

For example, if our input data contains columns for `Sales Rep` and `Deal Amount` and we're performing a **Sum** on the `Deal Amount` field, we could split by `Sales Rep` to get a **Sum** total for each Sales Rep.

To enter multiple fields to split by, enter a comma-separated list.

## Node options

### Continue if Field Not Found

By default, if a **Field to Summarize** isn't in any items, the node throws an error. Use this option to continue and return a single empty item (turned on) instead or keep the default error behavior (turned off).

### Disable Dot Notation

By default, n8n enables dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child`. Use this option to disable dot notation (turned on) or to continue using dot (turned off).

### Output Format

Select the format for your output format. This option is recommended if you're using **Fields to Split By**

* **Each Split in a Separate Item**: Use this option to generate a separate output item for each split out field.
* **All Splits in a Single Item**: Use this option to generate a single item that lists the split out fields.

## Ignore items without valid fields to group by

Set whether to ignore input items that don't contain the **Fields to Split By** (turned on) or not (turned off).

# Switch

Use the Switch node to route a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations. It's similar to the [IF](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if.md) node, but supports multiple output routes.

## Node parameters

Select the **Mode** the node should use:

* **Rules**: Select this mode to build a matching rule for each output.
* **Expression**: Select this mode to write an expression to return the output index programmatically.

Node configuration depends on the **Mode** you select.

### Rules

To configure the node with this operation, use these parameters:

* Create **Routing Rules** to define comparison conditions.
    * Use the data type dropdown to select the data type and comparison operation type for your condition. For example, to create a rules for dates after a particular date, select **Date & Time > is after**.
    * The fields and values to enter into the condition change based on the data type and comparison you select. Refer to [Available data type comparisons](#available-data-type-comparisons) for a full list of all comparisons by data type.
* **Rename Output**: Turn this control on to rename the output field to put matching data into. Enter your desired **Output Name**.

Select **Add Routing Rule** to add more rules.

#### Rule options

You can further configure the node with this operation using these **Options**:

- **Fallback Output**: Choose how to route the workflow when an item doesn't match any of the rules or conditions.
    - **None**: Ignore the item. This is the default behavior.
    - **Extra Output**: Send items to an extra, separate output.
    - **Output 0**: Send items to the same output as those matching the first rule.
- **Ignore Case**: Set whether to ignore letter case when evaluating conditions (turned on) or enforce letter case (turned off).
- **Less Strict Type Validation**: Set whether you want n8n to attempt to convert value types based on the operator you choose (turned on) or not (turned off).
- **Send data to all matching outputs**: Set whether to send data to all outputs meeting conditions (turned on) or whether to send the data to the first output matching the conditions (turned off).

### Expression

To configure the node with this operation, use these parameters:

- **Number of Outputs**: Set how many outputs the node should have.
- **Output Index**: Create an expression to calculate which input item should be routed to which output. The expression must return a number.

# Wait

Use the Wait node pause your workflow's execution. When the workflow pauses it offloads the execution data to the database. When the resume condition is met, the workflow reloads the data and the execution continues.

## Operations

The Wait node can **Resume** on the following conditions:

* [**After Time Interval**](#after-time-interval): The node waits for a certain amount of time.
* [**At Specified Time**](#at-specified-time): The node waits until a specific time.
* [**On Webhook Call**](#on-webhook-call): The node waits until it receives an HTTP call.
* [**On Form Submitted**](#on-form-submitted): The node waits until it receives a form submission.

Refer to the more detailed sections below for more detailed instructions.

### After Time Interval

Wait for a certain amount of time.

This parameter includes two more fields:

* **Wait Amount**: Enter the amount of time to wait.
* **Wait Unit**: Select the unit of measure for the **Wait Amount**. Choose from:
	* **Seconds**
	* **Minutes**
	* **Hours**
	* **Days**

Refer to [Time-based operations](#time-based-operations) for more detail on how these intervals work and the timezone used.

### At Specified Time

Wait until a specific date and time to continue. Use the date and time picker to set the **Date and Time**.

Refer to [Time-based operations](#time-based-operations) for more detail on the timezone used.

### On Webhook Call

This parameter enables your workflows to resume when the Wait node receives an HTTP call.

The webhook URL that resumes the execution when called is generated at runtime. The Wait node provides the `$execution.resumeUrl` variable so that you can reference and send the yet-to-be-generated URL wherever needed, for example to a third-party service or in an email. 

When the workflow executes, the Wait node generates the resume URL and the webhook(s) in your workflow using the `$execution.resumeUrl`. This generated URL is unique to each execution, so your workflow can contain multiple Wait nodes and as the webhook URL is called it will resume each Wait node sequentially.

For this **Resume** style, set more parameters listed below.

#### Authentication

Select if and how incoming resume-webhook-requests to `$execution.resumeUrl` should be authenticated. Options include:

* **Basic Auth**: Use basic authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for Basic Auth** to use.
* **Header Auth**: Use header authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for Header Auth** to use.
* **JWT Auth**: Use JWT authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for JWT Auth** to use.
* **None**: Don't use authentication.

/// note | Auth reference
Refer to the [Webhook node | Authentication documentation](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/index.md#supported-authentication-methods) for more information on each auth type.
///

#### HTTP Method

Select the HTTP method the webhook should use. Refer to the [Webhook node | HTTP Method documentation](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/index.md#http-method) for more information.

#### Response Code

Enter the Response Code the webhook should return. You can use common codes or enter a custom code.

#### Respond

Set when and how to respond to the webhook from these options:

* **Immediately**: Respond as soon as the node executes.
* **When Last Node Finishes**: Return the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow. If you select this option, also set:
	* **Response Data**: Select what data should be returned and what format to use. Options include:
		* **All Entries**: Returns all the entries of the last node in an array.
		* **First Entry JSON**: Return the JSON data of the first entry of the last node in a JSON object.
		* **First Entry Binary**: Return the binary data of the first entry of the last node in a binary file.
		* **No Response Body**: Return with no body.
* **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: Respond as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook.md) node.

#### Limit Wait Time

Set whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specific limit type (turned on) or not (turned off). If turned on, also set:

* **Limit Type**: Select what type of limit to enforce from these options:
	* **After Time Interval**: Wait for a certain amount of time.
		* Enter the limit's **Amount** of time.
		* Select the limit's **Unit** of time.
	* **At Specified Time**: Wait until a specific date and time to resume.
		* **Max Date and Time**: Use the date and time picker to set the specified time the node should resume.

#### On Webhook Call options

* **Binary Property**: Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to. This option's only relevant if binary data is received.
* **Ignore Bots**: Set whether to ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers (turned on) or not (turned off).
* **IP(s) Whitelist**: Enter IP addresses here to limit who (or what) can invoke the webhook URL. Enter a comma-separated list of allowed IP addresses. Access from IPs outside the whitelist throws a 403 error. If left blank, all IP addresses can invoke the webhook URL.
* **No Response Body**: Set whether n8n should send a body in the response (turned off) or prevent n8n from sending a body in the response (turned on).
* **Raw Body**: Set whether to return the body in a raw format like JSON or XML (turned on) or not (turned off).
* **Response Data**: Enter any custom data you want to send in the response.
* **Response Headers**: Send more headers in the webhook response. Refer to [MDN Web Docs | Response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header){:target=_blank .external-link} to learn more about response headers.
* **Webhook Suffix**: Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated `$resumeWebhookUrl` won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it.

#### On Webhook Call limitations

There are some limitations to keep in mind when using On Webhook Call:

* Partial executions of your workflow changes the `$resumeWebhookUrl`, so be sure that the node sending this URL to your desired third-party runs in the same execution as the Wait node.

### On Form Submitted

Wait for a form submission before continuing. Set up these parameters:

#### Form Title

Enter the title to display at the top of the form.

#### Form Description

Enter a form description to display beneath the title. This description can help prompt the user on how to complete the form.

#### Form Fields

Set up each field you want to appear on your form using these parameters:

* **Field Label**: Enter the field label you want to appear in the form.
* **Field Type**: Select the type of field to display in the form. Choose from:
	* **Date**
	* **Dropdown List**: Enter each dropdown options in the **Field Options**.
		* **Multiple Choice**: Select whether the user can select a single dropdown option (turned off) or multiple dropdown options (turned on)
	* **Number**
	* **Password**
	* **Text**
	* **Textarea**
* **Required Field**: Set whether the user must complete this field in order to submit the form (turned on) or if the user can submit the form without completing it (turned off).

#### Respond When

Set when to respond to the form submission. Choose from:

* **Form Is Submitted**: Respond as soon as this node receives the form submission.
* **Workflow Finishes**: Respond when the last node of this workflow finishes.
* **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: Respond when the [Respond to Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook.md) node executes.

#### Limit Wait Time

Set whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specific limit type (turned on) or not (turned off).

If turned on, also set:
* **Limit Type**: Select what type of limit to enforce from these options:
	* **After Time Interval**: Wait for a certain amount of time.
		* Enter the limit's **Amount** of time.
		* Select the limit's **Unit** of time.
	* **At Specified Time**: Wait until a specific date and time to resume.
		* **Max Date and Time**: Use the date and time picker to set the specified time the node should resume.

#### On Form Response options

* **Form Response**: Choose how and what you want the form to **Respond With** from these options:
	* **Form Submitted Text**: The form displays whatever text is entered in **Text to Show** after a user fills out the form. Use this option if you want to display a confirmation message.
	* **Redirect URL**: The form will redirect the user to the **URL to Redirect to** after they fill out the form. This must be a valid URL.
* **Webhook Suffix**: Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated `$resumeWebhookUrl` won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it.

## Templates and examples

[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'wait') ]]

## Time-based operations

For the time-based resume operations, note that:

* For wait times less than 65 seconds, the workflow doesn't offload execution data to the database. Instead, the process continues to run and the execution resumes after the specified interval passes.
* The n8n server time is always used regardless of the timezone setting. Workflow timezone settings, and any changes made to them, don't affect the Wait node interval or specified time.

# Common issues and questions

Here are some common issues and questions for the [Webhook node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/index.md) and suggested solutions.

## Listen for multiple HTTP methods

By default, the Webhook node accepts calls that use a single method. For example, it can accept GET or POST requests, but not both. If you want to accept calls using multiple methods:

1. Open the node **Settings**.
1. Turn on **Allow Multiple HTTP Methods**.
1. Return to **Parameters**. By default, the node now accepts GET and POST calls. You can add other methods in the **HTTP Methods** field.

The Webhook node has an output for each method, so you can perform different actions depending on the method.

## Use the HTTP Request node to trigger the Webhook node

The [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) node makes HTTP requests to the URL you specify.

1. Create a new workflow.
2. Add the HTTP Request node to the workflow.
3. Select a method from the **Request Method** dropdown list. For example, if you select GET as the **HTTP method** in your Webhook node, select GET as the request method in the HTTP Request node.
4. Copy the URL from the Webhook node, and paste it in the **URL** field in the HTTP Request node.
5. If using the test URL for the webhook node: execute the workflow with the Webhook node.
6. Execute the HTTP Request node.

## Use curl to trigger the Webhook node

You can use [curl](https://curl.se/){:target=_blank .external-link} to make HTTP requests that trigger the Webhook node. 

/// note
In the examples, replace `<https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>` with your webhook URL.  
The examples make GET requests. You can use whichever HTTP method you set in **HTTP Method**.
///

Make an HTTP request without any parameters:

```sh
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>
```

Make an HTTP request with a body parameter:

```sh
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --data 'key=value'
```

Make an HTTP request with header parameter:

```sh
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --header 'key=value'
```

Make an HTTP request to send a file:

```sh
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --from 'key=@/path/to/file'
```
Replace `/path/to/file` with the path of the file you want to send.

## Send a response of type string

By default, the response format is JSON or an array. To send a response of type string:

1. Select **Response Mode** > **When Last Node Finishes**.
2. Select **Response Data** > **First Entry JSON**.
3. Select **Add Option** > **Property Name**.
4. Enter the name of the property that contains the response. This defaults to `data`.
5. Connect an [Edit Fields node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set.md) to the Webhook node.
6. In the Edit Fields node, select **Add Value** > **String**.
7. Enter the name of the property in the **Name** field. The name should match the property name from step 4.
8. Enter the string value in the **Value** field.
9. Toggle **Keep Only Set** to on (green).

When you call the Webhook, it sends the string response from the Edit Fields node.

## Test URL versus Production URL

n8n generates two **Webhook URLs** for each Webhook node: a **Test URL** and a **Production URL**.

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL**. Once you're ready to use your Webhook URL in production, use the **Production URL**.

| **URL type** | **How to trigger** | **Listening duration** | **Data shown in editor UI?** | 
| :--- | --- | --- | :---: |
| Test URL | Select **Listen for test event** and trigger a test event from the source. | 120 seconds | :white_check_mark: |
| Production URL | Activate the workflow | Until workflow deactivated | :x: |

Refer to [Workflow development](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/workflow-development.md) for more information.

## IPs in Whitelist are failing to connect

If you're unable to connect from IPs in your IP Whitelist, check if you are running n8n behind a reverse proxy.

If so, set the `N8N_PROXY_HOPS` [environment variable](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/index.md) to the number of reverse-proxies n8n is running behind.

# Webhook node

Use the Webhook node to create [webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook){:target=_blank .external-link}, which can receive data from apps and services when an event occurs. It's a trigger node, which means it can start an n8n workflow. This allows services to connect to n8n and run a workflow.

You can use the Webhook node as a trigger for a workflow when you want to receive data and run a workflow based on the data. The Webhook node also supports returning the data generated at the end of a workflow. This makes it useful for building a workflow to process data and return the results, like an API endpoint.

The webhook allows you to trigger workflows from services that don't have a dedicated app trigger node.

## Workflow development process

n8n provides different **Webhook URL**s for testing and production. The testing URL includes an option to **Listen for test event**. Refer to [Workflow development](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/workflow-development.md) for more information on building, testing, and shifting your Webhook node to production.

## Node parameters

Use these parameters to configure your node.

### Webhook URLs

The Webhook node has two **Webhook URLs**: test and production. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel.

Select **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.

<figure markdown="span">
![Sample Webhook URLs in the Webhook node's Parameters tab display a Test URL and Production URL](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/webhook/webhook-urls.png)
<figcaption>Sample Webhook URLs in the Webhook node's Parameters tab</figcaption>
</figure>

* **Test**: n8n registers a test webhook when you select **Listen for Test Event** or **Execute workflow**, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the webhook URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.
* **Production**: n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution: select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.

### HTTP Method

The Webhook node supports standard [HTTP Request Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods){:target=_blank .external-link}:

* DELETE
* GET
* HEAD
* PATCH
* POST
* PUT

    /// note | Webhook max payload
	The webhook maximum payload size is 16MB.
  If you're self-hosting n8n, you can change this using the [endpoint environment variable](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/endpoints.md) `N8N_PAYLOAD_SIZE_MAX`.
	///	

### Path

By default, this field contains a randomly generated webhook URL path, to avoid conflicts with other webhook nodes. 

You can manually specify a URL path, including adding route parameters. For example, you may need to do this if you use n8n to prototype an API and want consistent endpoint URLs.

The **Path** field can take the following formats:

- `/:variable`
- `/path/:variable`
- `/:variable/path`
- `/:variable1/path/:variable2`
- `/:variable1/:variable2`

### Supported authentication methods

You can require authentication for any service calling your webhook URL. Choose from these authentication methods:

- Basic auth
- Header auth
- JWT auth
- None

Refer to [Webhook credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/webhook.md) for more information on setting up each credential type.

### Respond

* **Immediately**: The Webhook node returns the response code and the message **Workflow got started**.
* **When Last Node Finishes**: The Webhook node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.
* **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: The Webhook node responds as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook.md) node.

### Response Code

Customize the [HTTP response code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status){:target=_blank .external-link} that the Webhook node returns upon successful execution. Select from common response codes or create a custom code.

### Response Data

Choose what data to include in the response body:

* **All Entries**: The Webhook returns all the entries of the last node in an array.
* **First Entry JSON**: The Webhook returns the JSON data of the first entry of the last node in a JSON object.
* **First Entry Binary**: The Webhook returns the binary data of the first entry of the last node in a binary file.
* **No Response Body**: The Webhook returns without a body.

Applies only to **Respond > When Last Node Finishes**.

## Node options

Select **Add Option** to view more configuration options. The available options depend on your node parameters. Refer to the table for option availability.

* **Allowed Origins (CORS)**: Set the permitted cross-origin domains. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests. Use `*` (default) to allow all origins.
* **Binary Property**: Enabling this setting allows the Webhook node to receive binary data, such as an image or audio file. Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to.
* **Ignore Bots**: Ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers.
* **IP(s) Whitelist**: Enable this to limit who (or what) can invoke a Webhook trigger URL. Enter a comma-separated list of allowed IP addresses. Access from IPs outside the whitelist throws a 403 error. If left blank, all IP addresses can invoke the webhook trigger URL.
* **No Response Body**: Enable this to prevent n8n sending a body with the response.
* **Raw Body**: Specify that the Webhook node will receive data in a raw format, such as JSON or XML.
* **Response Content-Type**: Choose the format for the webhook body.
* **Response Data**: Send custom data with the response.
* **Response Headers**: Send extra headers in the Webhook response. Refer to [MDN Web Docs | Response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header){:target=_blank .external-link} to learn more about response headers.
* **Property Name**: by default, n8n returns all available data. You can choose to return a specific JSON key, so that n8n returns the value.

| Option | Required node configuration |
| ------ | --------------------------- | 
| Allowed Origins (CORS) | Any |
| Binary Property | Either: <br />HTTP Method > POST <br /> HTTP Method > PATCH <br /> HTTP Method > PUT |
| Ignore Bots | Any |

# Workflow development

The [Webhook node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/index.md) works a bit differently from other core nodes. n8n recommends following these processes for building, testing, and using your Webhook node in production.

n8n generates two **Webhook URLs** for each Webhook node: a **Test URL** and a **Production URL**.

## Build and test workflows

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test** webhook URL.

Using a test webhook ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging. Select **Listen for test event** to register the webhook before sending the data to the test webhook. The test webhook stays active for 120 seconds.

When using the Webhook node on localhost on a [self-hosted](/hosting/index.md) n8n instance, run n8n in tunnel mode:

* [npm with tunnel](/hosting/installation/npm.md#n8n-with-tunnel)
* [Docker with tunnel](/hosting/installation/docker.md#n8n-with-tunnel)

<video src="/_video/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/webhook/webhook-node-intro.mp4" controls width="100%"></video>

## Production workflows

When your workflow is ready, switch to using the **Production** webhook URL. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when an external service calls the webhook URL.

When working with a Production webhook, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the webhook isn't visible in the editor UI with the production webhook.

Refer to [Create a workflow](/workflows/create.md) for more information on activating workflows.

# Workflow Trigger node

The Workflow Trigger node gets triggered when a workflow is updated or activated.

/// warning | Deprecated
n8n has deprecated the Workflow Trigger node and moved its functionality to the [n8n Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8ntrigger.md).
///

/// note | Keep in mind
If you want to use the Workflow Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.
///

The Workflow Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Workflow Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.

## Node parameters

The node includes a single parameter to identify the **Events** that should trigger it. Choose from these events:

- **Active Workflow Updated**: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is updated.
- **Workflow Activated**: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is activated.

You can select one or both of these events.

# Chat Trigger node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Chat Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Pass data from a website to an embedded Chat Trigger node

When [embedding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/chat) the Chat Trigger node in a website, you might want to pass extra information to the Chat Trigger. For example, passing a user ID stored in a site cookie.

To do this, use the `metadata` field in the JSON object you pass to the `createChat` function in your embedded chat window:

```javascript
createChat({
	webhookUrl: 'YOUR_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL',
	metadata: {
		'YOUR_KEY': 'YOUR_DATA'
	};
});
```

The `metadata` field can contain arbitrary data that will appear in the Chat Trigger output alongside other output data. From there, you can query and process the data from downstream nodes as usual using	n8n's [data processing features](/data/index.md).

## Chat Trigger node doesn't fetch previous messages

When you configure a Chat Trigger node, you might experience problems fetching previous messages if you aren't careful about how you configure session loading. This often manifests as a `workflow could not be started!` error.

In Chat Triggers, the **Load Previous Session** option retrieves previous chat messages for a session using the `sessionID`. When you set the **Load Previous Session** option to **From memory**, it's almost always best to [connect the same memory node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/index.md#load-previous-session) to both the Chat Trigger and the Agent in your workflow:

1. In your **Chat Trigger** node, set the **Load Previous Session** option to **From Memory**. This is only visible if you've made the chat publicly available.
2. Attach a **Simple Memory** node to the **Memory** connector.
3. Attach the same **Simple Memory** node to **Memory** connector of your **Agent**.
4. In the **Simple Memory** node, set **Session ID** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node**.

One instance where you may want to attach separate memory nodes to your Chat Trigger and the Agent is if you want to set the **Session ID** in your memory node to **Define below**.

If you're retrieving the session ID from an expression, the same expression must work for each of the nodes attached to it. If the expression isn't compatible with each of the nodes that need memory, you might need to use separate memory nodes so you can customize the expression for the session ID on a per-node basis.

# Chat Trigger node

Use the Chat Trigger node when building AI workflows for chatbots and other chat interfaces. You can configure how users access the chat, using one of n8n's provided interfaces, or your own. You can add authentication.

You must connect either an agent or chain [root node](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/index.md).

/// warning | Workflow execution usage
Every message to the Chat Trigger executes your workflow. This means that one conversation where a user sends 10 messages uses 10 executions from your execution allowance. Check your payment plan for details of your allowance.
///

/// note | Manual Chat trigger
This node replaces the Manual Chat Trigger node from version 1.24.0.
///

## Node parameters

### Make Chat Publicly Available

Set whether the chat should be publicly available (turned on) or only available through the manual chat interface (turned off).

Leave this turned off while you're building the workflow. Turn it on when you're ready to activate the workflow and allow users to access the chat.

### Mode

Choose how users access the chat. Select from:

* **Hosted Chat**: Use n8n's hosted chat interface. Recommended for most users because you can configure the interface using the [node options](#node-options) and don't have to do any other setup.
* **Embedded Chat**: This option requires you to create your own chat interface. You can use n8n's [chat widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/chat){:target=_blank .external-link} or build your own. Your chat interface must call the webhook URL shown in **Chat URL** in the node.

### Authentication

Choose whether and how to restrict access to the chat. Select from:

* **None**: The chat doesn't use authentication. Anyone can use the chat.
* **Basic Auth**: The chat uses basic authentication.
	* Select or create a **Credential for Basic Auth** with a username and password. All users must use the same username and password.
* **n8n User Auth**: Only users logged in to an n8n account can use the chat.

### Initial Message(s)

This parameter's only available if you're using **Hosted Chat**. Use it to configure the message the n8n chat interface displays when the user arrives on the page.

## Node options

Available options depend on the chat mode.

### Hosted chat options

#### Allowed Origin (CORS)

Set the origins that can access the chat URL. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests.

Use `*` (default) to allow all origins.

#### Input Placeholder, Title, and Subtitle

Enter the text for these elements in the chat interface.

??? Details "View screenshot"
	![Customizable text elements](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/chat-trigger/hosted-text-elements.png)

#### Load Previous Session

Select whether to load chat messages from a previous chat session.

If you select any option other than **Off**, you must connect the Chat trigger and the Agent you're using to a memory sub-node. The memory connector on the Chat trigger appears when you set **Load Previous Session** to **From Memory**. n8n recommends connecting both the Chat trigger and Agent to the same memory sub-node, as this ensures a single source of truth for both nodes.

??? Details "View screenshot"
	![Connect nodes to memory](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/chat-trigger/connect-memory.png)

#### Response Mode

Use this option when building a workflow with steps after the agent or chain that's handling the chat. Choose from:

* **When Last Node Finishes**: The Chat Trigger node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.
* **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: The Chat Trigger node responds as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook.md) node.

#### Require Button Click to Start Chat

Set whether to display a **New Conversation** button on the chat interface (turned on) or not (turned off).

??? Details "View screenshot"
	![New Conversation button](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/chat-trigger/new-conversation-button.png)


### Embedded chat options

#### Allowed Origin (CORS)

Set the origins that can access the chat URL. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests.

Use `*` (default) to allow all origins.

#### Load Previous Session

Select whether to load chat messages from a previous chat session.

If you select any option other than **Off**, you must connect the Chat trigger and the Agent you're using to a memory sub-node. The memory connector on the Chat trigger appears when you set **Load Previous Session** to **From Memory**. n8n recommends connecting both the Chat trigger and Agent to the same memory sub-node, as this ensures a single source of truth for both nodes.

## Set the chat response manually

You need to manually set the chat response when you don't want to directly send the output of an Agent or Chain node to the user. Instead, you want to take the output of an Agent or Chain node and modify it or do something else with it before sending it back to the user.

In a basic workflow, the Agent and Chain nodes output a parameter named either `output` or `text`, and the Chat trigger sends the value of this parameter to the user as the chat response. 

If you need to manually create the response sent to the user, you must create a parameter named either `text` or `output`. If you use a different parameter name, the Chat trigger sends the entire object as its response, not just the value.

# MCP Server Trigger node

Use the MCP Server Trigger node to allow n8n to act as a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server, making n8n tools and workflows available to MCP clients.

///  note  | Credentials
You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest.md).
///

## How the MCP Server Trigger node works

The MCP Server Trigger node acts as an entry point into n8n for MCP clients. It operates by exposing a URL that MCP clients can interact with to access n8n tools.

Unlike conventional [trigger nodes](/glossary.md#trigger-node-n8n), which respond to events and pass their output to the next [connected node](/workflows/components/connections.md), the MCP Server Trigger node only connects to and executes [tool](/advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools.md) nodes. Clients can list the available tools and call individual tools to perform work.

You can expose n8n workflows to clients by attaching them with the [Custom n8n Workflow Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow.md) node.

/// note | Server-Sent Events (SSE) support
The MCP Server Trigger node supports [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#server-sent-events-sse), a long-lived transport built on top of HTTP, for connections between clients and the server. It currently doesn't support [standard input/output (stdio)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#standard-input%2Foutput-stdio) transport.
///

## Node parameters

Use these parameters to configure your node.

### MCP URL

The MCP Server Trigger node has two **MCP URLs**: test and production. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel.

Select **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.

* **Test**: n8n registers a test MCP URL when you select **Listen for Test Event** or **Execute workflow**, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the MCP URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.
* **Production**: n8n registers a production MCP URL when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution: select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.

### Authentication

You can require authentication for clients connecting to your MCP URL. Choose from these authentication methods:

- Bearer auth
- Header auth

Refer to the [HTTP request credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest.md) for more information on setting up each credential type.

### Path

By default, this field contains a randomly generated MCP URL path, to avoid conflicts with other MCP Server Trigger nodes. 

You can manually specify a URL path, including adding route parameters. For example, you may need to do this if you use n8n to prototype an API and want consistent endpoint URLs.

The **Path** field can take the following formats:

- `/:variable`
- `/path/:variable`
- `/:variable/path`
- `/:variable1/path/:variable2`
- `/:variable1/:variable2`

## Templates and examples

<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->
[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'mcp-server-trigger') ]]

### Integrating with Claude Desktop

You can connect to the MCP Server Trigger node from [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) by running a gateway to proxy SSE messages to stdio-based servers.

To do so, add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "supergateway",
        "--sse",
        "<MCP_URL>",
        "--header",
        "Authorization: Bearer <MCP_BEARER_TOKEN>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Be sure to replace the `<MCP_URL>` and `<MCP_BEARER_TOKEN>` placeholders with the values from your MCP Server Trigger node parameters and credentials.

## Limitations

### Configuring the MCP Server Trigger node with webhook replicas

The MCP Server Trigger node relies on Server-Sent Events (SSE), which require the same server instance to handle persistent connections. This can cause problems when running n8n in [queue mode](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode.md) depending on your [webhook processor](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode.md#webhook-processors) configuration:

* If you use queue mode with a **single webhook replica**, the MCP Server Trigger node works as expected.
* If you run **multiple webhook replicas**, you need to route all `/mcp*` requests to a single, dedicated webhook replica. Create a separate replica set with one webhook container for MCP requests. Afterward, update your ingress or load balancer configuration to direct all `/mcp*` traffic to that instance.

/// warning | Caution when running with multiple webhook replicas
If you run an MCP Server Trigger node with multiple webhook replicas and don't route all `/mcp*` requests to a single, dedicated webhook replica, your SSE connections will frequently break or fail to reliably deliver events.
///

## Related resources

n8n also provides an [MCP Client Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolmcp.md) node that allows you to connect your n8n AI agents to external tools.

Refer to the [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) and [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/) for more details about the protocol, servers, and clients.

## Common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the MCP Server Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Running the MCP Server Trigger node with a reverse proxy

When running n8n behind a reverse proxy like nginx, you may experience problems if the MCP endpoint isn't configured for SSE.

Specifically, you need to disable proxy buffering for the endpoint. Other items you might want to adjust include disabling gzip compression (n8n handles this itself), disabling chunked transfer encoding, and setting the `Connection` to an empty string to remove it from the forwarded headers. Explicitly disabling these in the MCP endpoint ensures they're not inherited from other places in your nginx configuration.

An example nginx location block for serving MCP traffic with these settings may look like this:

```
location /mcp/ {
    proxy_http_version          1.1;
    proxy_buffering             off;
    gzip                        off;
    chunked_transfer_encoding   off;

    proxy_set_header            Connection '';

    # The rest of your proxy headers and settings
    # . . .
}
```

7. Select **Create access key**.
8. Reveal the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** and enter them in n8n.
10. To use a **Temporary security credential**, turn that option on and add a **Session token**. Refer to the [AWS Temporary security credential documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on working with temporary security credentials.
11. If you use [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/){:target=_blank .external-link} to host n8n, you can establish a connection between your VPC and some apps. Use **Custom Endpoints** to enter relevant custom endpoint(s) for this connection. This setup works with these apps:
    - Rekognition
    - Lambda
    - SNS
    - SES
    - SQS
    - S3

You can also generate access keys through the AWS CLI and AWS API.

## Using OAuth2

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/cloud-oauth-button.md"

For self-hosted users, there are two main steps to configure OAuth2 from scratch:

1. [Register an application](#register-an-application) with the Microsoft Identity Platform.
2. [Generate a client secret](#generate-a-client-secret) for that application.

Follow the detailed instructions for each step below. For more detail on the Microsoft OAuth2 web flow, refer to [Microsoft authentication and authorization basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). 

### Register an application

Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform:

1. Open the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://aka.ms/appregistrations).
2. Select **Register an application**.
3. Enter a **Name** for your app.
4. In **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multi-tenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (for example, Skype, Xbox)**.
5. In **Register an application**:
    1. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from your n8n credential.
    2. Paste it into the **Redirect URI (optional)** field.
    3. Select **Select a platform** > **Web**.
6. Select **Register** to finish creating your application.
7. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and paste it into n8n as the **Client ID**.

Refer to [Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2) for more information.

### Generate a client secret

With your application created, generate a client secret for it:

1. On your Microsoft application page, select **Certificates & secrets** in the left navigation.
1. In **Client secrets**, select **+ New client secret**.
1. Enter a **Description** for your client secret, such as `n8n credential`.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Copy the **Secret** in the **Value** column.
1. Paste it into n8n as the **Client Secret**.
1. Select **Connect my account** in n8n to finish setting up the connection.
1. Log in to your Microsoft account and allow the app to access your info.

Refer to Microsoft's [Add credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#add-credentials) for more information on adding a client secret.

## Using Shared Key

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* An **Account**: The name of your Azure Storage account.
* A **Key**: A shared key for your Azure Storage account. Select **Security + networking** and then **Access keys**. You can use either of the two account keys for this purpose.

Refer to [Manage storage account access keys | Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage) for more detailed steps.

# Customer.io credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes with Customer.io.

- [Customer.io](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.customerio.md)
- [Customer.io Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.customeriotrigger.md)

## Prerequisites

Create a [Customer.io](https://customer.io/) account.

## Supported authentication methods

- API Key

## Related resources

Refer to [Customer.io's summary API documentation](https://customer.io/docs/api/?api=journeys){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

For detailed API reference documentation for each API, refer to the [Track API documentation](https://customer.io/docs/api/track/){:target=_blank .external-link} and the [App API documentation](https://customer.io/docs/api/app/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Using API key

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Tracking API Key**: For use with the [Track API](https://customer.io/docs/api/track/){:target=_blank .external-link} at `https://track.customer.io/api/v1/`. See the FAQs below for more details.
- Your **Region**: Customer.io uses different API subdomains depending on the region you select. Options include:
    - **Global region**: Keeps the default URLs for both APIs; for use in all non-EU countries/regions.
    - **EU region**: Adjusts the Track API subdomain to `track-eu` and the App API subdomain to `api-eu`; only use this if you are in the EU.
- A **Tracking Site ID**: Required with your **Tracking API Key**
- An **App API Key**: For use with the [App API](https://customer.io/docs/api/app/){:target=_blank .external-link} at `https://api.customer.io/v1/api/`. See the FAQs below for more details.

Refer to the [Customer.io Finding and managing your API credentials documentation](https://customer.io/docs/accounts-and-workspaces/managing-credentials/){:target=_blank .external-link} for instructions on creating both Tracking API and App API keys.

## Why you need a Tracking API Key and an App API Key

Customer.io has two different API endpoints and generates and stores the keys for each slightly differently:

- The [Track API](https://customer.io/docs/api/track/){:target=_blank .external-link} at `https://track.customer.io/api/v1/`
- The [App API](https://customer.io/docs/api/app/){:target=_blank .external-link} at `https://api.customer.io/v1/api/`

The Track API requires a Tracking Site ID; the App API doesn't.

Based on the operation you want to perform, n8n uses the correct API key and its corresponding endpoint.

- Webhook

Not sure which method to use? Refer to [Choose an authentication method](#choose-an-authentication-method) for more guidance.

## Related resources

Refer to [Discord's Developer documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using bot

Use this method if you want to add the bot to your Discord server using a bot token rather than OAuth2.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Bot Token**: Generated once you create an application with a bot.

To create an application with a bot and generate the **Bot Token**:

1. If you don't have one already, create an app in the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications?new_application=true){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. Enter a **Name** for your app.
3. Select **Create**.
4. Select **Bot** from the left menu.
5. Under **Token**, select **Reset Token** to generate a new bot token. 
6. Copy the token and add it to your n8n credential.
7. In **Bot > Privileged Gateway Intents**, add any privileged intents you want your bot to have. Refer to [Configuring your bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#configuring-your-bot){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on privileged intents.
    - n8n recommends activating **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT: Required for your bot to receive events listed under GUILD_MEMBERS**. 
8. In **Installation > Installation Contexts**, select the installation contexts you want your bot to use:
    - Select **Guild Install** for server-installed apps. (Most common for n8n users.)
    - Select **User Install** for user-installed apps. (Less common for n8n users, but may be useful for testing.)
    - Refer to Discord's [Choosing installation contexts](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#choosing-installation-contexts){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information about these installation contexts.
9. In **Installation > Install Link**, select **Discord Provided Link** if it's not already selected.
10. Still on the **Installation** page, in the **Default Install Settings** section, select `applications.commands` and `bot` scopes. Refer to Discord's [Scopes](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#shared-resources-oauth2-scopes){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information about these and other scopes.
11. Add permissions on the **Bot > Bot Permissions** page. Refer to Discord's [Permissions](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information. n8n recommends selecting these permissions for the [Discord](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/index.md) node:
    - Manage Roles
    - Manage Channels
    - Read Messages/View Channels
    - Send Messages
    - Create Public Threads
    - Create Private Threads
    - Send Messages in Threads
    - Send TTS Messages
    - Manage Messages
    - Manage Threads
    - Embed Links
    - Attach Files
    - Read Message History
    - Add Reactions
12. Add the app to your server or test server:
    1. Go to **Installation > Install Link** and copy the link listed there.
    2. Paste the link in your browser and hit Enter.
    1. Select **Add to server** in the installation prompt.
    1. Once your app's added to your server, you'll see it in the member list.

These steps outline the basic functionality needed to set up your n8n credential. Refer to the [Discord Creating an App](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-1-creating-an-app){:target=_blank .external-link} guide for more information on creating an app, especially:

- [Fetching your credentials](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#fetching-your-credentials){:target=_blank .external-link} for getting your app's credentials into your local developer environment.
- [Handling interactivity](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-3-handling-interactivity){:target=_blank .external-link} for information on setting up public endpoints for interactive `/slash` commands.

## Using OAuth2

Use this method if you want to add the bot to Discord servers using the OAuth2 flow, which simplifies the process for those installing your app.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**
- A **Client Secret**
- Choose whether to send **Authentication** in the **Header** or **Body**
- A **Bot Token**

For details on creating an application with a bot and generating the token, follow the same steps as in [Using bot](#using-bot) above.

Then:

1. Copy the **Bot Token** you generate and add it into the n8n credential.
2. Open the **OAuth2** page in your Discord application to access your **Client ID** and generate a **Client Secret**. Add these to your n8n credential.
3. From n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** and add it into the Discord application in **OAuth2 > Redirects**. Be sure you save these changes.

## Using webhook

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Webhook URL**: Generated once you create a webhook.

To get a Webhook URL, you create a webhook and copy the URL that gets generated:

1. Open your Discord **Server Settings** and open the **Integrations** tab.
2. Select **Create Webhook** to create a new webhook.
3. Give your webhook a **Name** that makes sense.
3. Select the **avatar** next to the **Name** to edit or upload a new avatar.
4. In the **CHANNEL** dropdown, select the channel the webhook should post to.
5. Select **Copy Webhook URL** to copy the Webhook URL. Enter this URL in your n8n credential.

Refer to the [Discord Making a Webhook documentation](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

## Choose an authentication method

The simplest installation is a **webhook**. You create and add webhooks to a single channel on a Discord server. Webhooks can post messages to a channel. They don't require a bot user or authentication. But they can't listen or respond to user requests or commands. If you need a straightforward way to send messages to a channel without the need for interaction or feedback, use a webhook.

A **bot** is an interactive step up from a webhook. You add bots to the Discord server (referred to as a `guild` in the Discord API documentation) or to user accounts. Bots added to the server can interact with users on all the server's channels. They can manage channels, send and retrieve messages, retrieve the list of all users, and change their roles. If you need to build an interactive, complex, or multi-step workflow, use a bot.

**OAuth2** is basically a **bot** that uses an OAuth2 flow rather than just the bot token. As with bots, you add these to the Discord server or to user accounts. These credentials offer the same functionalities as bots, but they can simplify the installation of the bot on your server.

# Drift credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Drift](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.drift.md)

## Prerequisites

- Create a [Drift](https://www.drift.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account.
- [Create a Drift app](https://devdocs.drift.com/docs/quick-start#3-install-it-to-your-drift-account-){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Supported authentication methods

- API personal access token
- OAuth2

## Related resources

Refer to [Drift's API documentation](https://devdocs.drift.com/docs/using-drift-apis){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API personal access token

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Personal Access Token**: To get a token, [create a Drift app](https://devdocs.drift.com/docs/quick-start#3-install-it-to-your-drift-account-){:target=_blank .external-link}. [Install the app](https://devdocs.drift.com/docs/quick-start#3-install-it-to-your-drift-account-){:target=_blank .external-link} to generate an OAuth Access token. Add this to the n8n credential as your **Personal Access Token**.

## Using OAuth2

# Dropbox credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Dropbox](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.dropbox.md)

## Supported authentication methods

- API access token: Dropbox recommends this method for testing with your user account and granting a limited number of users access.
- OAuth2: Dropbox recommends this method for production or for testing with more than 50 users.

/// note | App reuse
You can transition an app from the API access token to OAuth2 by creating a new credential in n8n for OAuth2 using the same app.
///

## Related resources

Refer to [Dropbox's Developer documentation](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using access token

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/developers){:target=_blank .external-link} developer account and:

- An **Access Token**: Generated once you create a Dropbox app.
- An **App Access Type**

To set up the credential, create a Dropbox app:

1. Open the [App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps){:target=_blank .external-link} within the Dropbox developer portal.
2. Select **Create app**.
3. In **Choose an API**, select **Scoped access**.
4. In **Choose the type of access you need**, choose whichever option best fits your use of the [Dropbox](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.dropbox.md) node:
    - **App Folder** grants access to a single folder created specifically for your app.
    - **Full Dropbox** grants access to all files and folders in your user's Dropbox.
    - Refer to the [DBX Platform developer guide](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/developer-guide){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
5. In **Name your app**, enter a name for your app, like `n8n integration`.
6. Check the box to agree to the **Dropbox API Terms and Conditions**.
7. Select **Create app**. The app's **Settings** open.
8. In the **OAuth 2** section, in **Generated access token**, select **Generate**.
9. Copy the access token and enter it as the **Access Token** in your n8n credential.
10. In n8n, select the same **App Access Type** you selected for your app.

Refer to the [Dropbox App Console Settings documentation](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/getting-started){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

/// warning | User limits
On the **Settings** tab, you can add other users to your app, even with the access token method. Once your app links 50 Dropbox users, you will have two weeks to apply for and receive production status approval before Dropbox freezes your app from linking more users.
///

## Using OAuth2

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/cloud-oauth-button.md"

Cloud users need to select the **App Access Type**:

- **App Folder** grants access to a single folder created specifically for your app.
- **Full Dropbox** grants access to all files and folders in your user's Dropbox.
- Refer to the [DBX Platform developer guide](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/developer-guide){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

If you're [self-hosting](/hosting/index.md) n8n, you'll need to configure OAuth2 manually:

1. Open the [App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps){:target=_blank .external-link} within the Dropbox developer portal.
2. Select **Create app**.
3. In **Choose an API**, select **Scoped access**.
4. In **Choose the type of access you need**, choose whichever option best fits your use of the [Dropbox](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.dropbox.md) node:
    - **App Folder** grants access to a single folder created specifically for your app.
    - **Full Dropbox** grants access to all files and folders in your user's Dropbox.
    - Refer to the [DBX Platform developer guide](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/developer-guide){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
5. In **Name your app**, enter a name for your app, like `n8n integration`.
6. Check the box to agree to the **Dropbox API Terms and Conditions**.
7. Select **Create app**. The app's **Settings** open.
8. Copy the **App key** and enter it as the **Client ID** in your n8n credential.
9. Copy the **Secret** and enter it as the **Client Secret** in your n8n credential.
10. In n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** and enter it in the Dropbox **Redirect URIs**.
11. In n8n, select the same **App Access Type** you selected for your app.

Refer to the instructions in the [Dropbox Implementing OAuth documentation](https://developers.dropbox.com/oauth-guide#implementing-oauth){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

For internal tools and limited usage, you can keep your app private. But if you'd like your app to be used by more than 50 users or you want to distribute it, you'll need to complete Dropbox's production approval process. Refer to **Production Approval** in the [DBX Platform developer guide](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/developer-guide){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

/// warning | User limits
On the **Settings** tab, you can add other users to your app. Once your app links 50 Dropbox users, you will have two weeks to apply for and receive production status approval before Dropbox freezes your app from linking more users.

/// note | Facebook Graph API credentials
If you want to create credentials for the [Facebook Graph API](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebookgraphapi.md) node, follow the instructions in the [Facebook Graph API credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookgraph.md) documentation.
///

## Supported authentication methods

- App access token

## Related resources

Refer to [Meta's Graph API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using app access token

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account and:

- An app **Access Token**
- An optional **App Secret**: Used to verify the integrity and origin of the payload.

There are five steps in setting up your credential:

1. [Create a Meta app](#create-a-meta-app) with the Webhooks product.
2. [Generate an App Access Token](#generate-an-app-access-token) for that app.
3. [Configure the Facebook trigger](#configure-the-facebook-trigger).
4. Optional: [Add an app secret](#optional-add-an-app-secret).
5. [App Review](#app-review): Only required if your app's users don't have roles on the app itself. If you're creating the app for your own internal purposes, this isn't necessary.

Refer to the detailed instructions below for each step.

### Create a Meta app

To create a Meta app:

1. Go to the Meta Developer [App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps){:target=_blank .external-link} and select **Create App**.
2. If you have a business portfolio and you're ready to connect the app to it, select the business portfolio. If you don't have a business portfolio or you're not ready to connect the app to the portfolio, select **I don’t want to connect a business portfolio yet** and select **Next**. The **Use cases** page opens.
3. Select **Other**, then select **Next**.
4. Select **Business** and **Next**.
5. Complete the essential information:
    * Add an **App name**.
    * Add an **App contact email**.
    * Here again you can connect to a business portfolio or skip it.
1. Select **Create app**.
1. The **Add products to your app** page opens.
1. Select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
1. Enter a **Privacy Policy URL**. (Required to take the app "Live.")
1. Select **Save changes**.
1. At the top of the page, toggle the **App Mode** from **Development** to **Live**.
1. In the left menu, select **Add Product**.
6. The **Add products to your app** page appears. Select **Webhooks**.
7. The **Webhooks** product opens.

Refer to Meta's [Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information on creating an app, required fields like the Privacy Policy URL, and adding products.

For more information on the app modes and switching to **Live** mode, refer to [App Modes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-modes){:target=_blank .external-link} and [Publish | App Types](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release#app-types){:target=_blank .external-link}.

### Generate an App Access Token

Next, create an app access token to be used by your n8n credential and the Webhooks product:

1. In a separate tab or window, open the [Graph API explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. Select the **Meta App** you just created in the **Access Token** section.
3. In **User or Page**, select **Get App Token**.
4. Select **Generate Access Token**.
5. The page prompts you to log in and grant access. Follow the on-screen prompts.

    /// warning | App unavailable
    You may receive a warning that the app isn't available. Once you take an app live, there may be a few minutes' delay before you can generate an access token.
    ///

5. Copy the token and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Access Token**. Save this token somewhere else, too, since you'll need it for the Webhooks configuration.
6. Save your n8n credential.

Refer to the Meta instructions for [Your First Request](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/get-started#get-started){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on generating the token.

### Configure the Facebook Trigger

Now that you have a token, you can configure the Facebook Trigger node:

1. In your Meta app, copy the **App ID** from the top navigation bar.
1. In n8n, open your Facebook Trigger node.
2. Paste the **App ID** into the **APP ID** field.
3. Select **Execute step** to shift the trigger into listening mode.
6. Return to the tab or window where your Meta app's **Webhooks** product configuration is open.
7. **Subscribe** to the objects you want to receive Facebook Trigger notifications about. For each subscription:
    1. Copy the **Webhook URL** from n8n and enter it as the **Callback URL** in your Meta App.
    1. Enter the **Access Token** you copied above as the **Verify token**.
    1. Select **Verify and save**. (This step fails if you don't have your n8n trigger listening.)
    1. Some webhook subscriptions, like **User**, prompt you to subscribe to individual events. Subscribe to the events you're interested in.
    1. You can send some **Test** events from Meta to confirm things are working. If you send a test event, verify its receipt in n8n.

Refer to the [Facebook Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebooktrigger/index.md) documentation for more information.

### Optional: Add an App Secret

For added security, Meta recommends adding an **App Secret**. This signs all API calls with the `appsecret_proof` parameter. The app secret proof is a sha256 hash of your access token, using your app secret as the key.

To generate an App Secret:

1. In Meta while viewing your app, select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
1. Select **Show** next to the **App secret** field.
1. The page prompts you to re-enter your Facebook account credentials. Once you do so, Meta shows the App Secret.
1. Highlight it to select it, copy it, and paste this into your n8n credential as the **App Secret**.
1. **Save** your n8n credential.

Refer to the [App Secret documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/security#appsecret){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

### App review

App Review requires Business Verification.

Your app must go through App Review if it will be used by someone who:

- Doesn't have a role on the app itself.
- Doesn't have a role in the Business that has claimed the app.

If your only app users are users who have a role on the app itself, App Review isn't required.

As part of the App Review process, you may need to request advanced access for your webhook subscriptions.

Refer to Meta's [App Review](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/resp-plat-initiatives/app-review){:target=_blank .external-link} and [Advanced Access](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview/access-levels#advanced-access){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information.

## Common issues

### Unverified apps limit

Facebook only lets you have a developer or administrator role on a maximum of 15 apps that aren't already linked to a Meta Verified Business Account.

Refer to [Limitations | Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app#limitations){:target=_blank .external-link} if you're over that limit.

# Facebook Graph API credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Facebook Graph API](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebookgraphapi.md)

/// note | Facebook Trigger credentials
If you want to create credentials for the [Facebook Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebooktrigger/index.md) node, follow the instructions mentioned in the [Facebook App credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookapp.md) documentation.
///

## Supported authentication methods

- App access token

## Related resources

Refer to [Meta's Graph API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using app access token

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account and:

- An app **Access Token**

There are two steps in setting up your credential:

1. [Create a Meta app](#create-a-meta-app) with the products you need to access.
2. [Generate an App Access Token](#generate-an-app-access-token) for that app.

Refer to the detailed instructions below for each step.

### Create a Meta app

To create a Meta app:

1. Go to the Meta Developer [App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps){:target=_blank .external-link} and select **Create App**.
2. If you have a business portfolio and you're ready to connect the app to it, select the business portfolio. If you don't have a business portfolio or you're not ready to connect the app to the portfolio, select **I don’t want to connect a business portfolio yet** and select **Next**. The **Use cases** page opens.
3. Select the **Use case** that aligns with how you wish to use the Facebook Graph API. For example, for products in Meta's **Business** suite (like Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Marketing API, App Events, Audience Network, Commerce API, Fundraisers, Jobs, Threat Exchange, and Webhooks), select **Other**, then select **Next**.
4. Select **Business** and **Next**.
5. Complete the essential information:
    * Add an **App name**.
    * Add an **App contact email**.
    * Here again you can connect to a business portfolio or skip it.
1. Select **Create app**.
1. The **Add products to your app** page opens.
1. Select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
1. Enter a **Privacy Policy URL**. (Required to take the app "Live.")
1. Select **Save changes**.
1. At the top of the page, toggle the **App Mode** from **Development** to **Live**.
1. In the left menu, select **Add Product**.
6. The **Add products to your app** page appears. Select the products that make sense for your app and configure them.

Refer to Meta's [Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information on creating an app, required fields like the Privacy Policy URL, and adding products.

For more information on the app modes and switching to **Live** mode, refer to [App Modes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-modes){:target=_blank .external-link} and [Publish | App Types](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release#app-types){:target=_blank .external-link}.

### Generate an App Access Token

Next, create an app access token to use with your n8n credential and the products you selected:

1. In a separate tab or window, open the [Graph API explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. Select the **Meta App** you just created in the **Access Token** section.
3. In **User or Page**, select **Get App Token**.
4. Select **Generate Access Token**.
5. The page prompts you to log in and grant access. Follow the on-screen prompts.

    /// warning | App unavailable
    You may receive a warning that the app isn't available. Once you take an app live, there may be a few minutes' delay before you can generate an access token.
    ///

5. Copy the token and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Access Token**.

Refer to the Meta instructions for [Your First Request](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/get-started#get-started){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on generating the token.

# Facebook Lead Ads credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [Facebook Lead Ads trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebookleadadstrigger.md)

## Supported authentication methods

- OAuth2

## Related resources

Refer to [Facebook Lead Ads' documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/guides/lead-ads/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/facebook-lead-ads-trigger/){:target=_blank .external-link} on n8n's website.

## Using OAuth2

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account and:

- A **Client ID**
- A **Client Secret**

To get both, [create a Meta app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app){:target=_blank .external-link} with either the Facebook Login product or the Facebook Login for Business product.

To create your app and set up the credential with **Facebook Login for Business**:

1. Go to the Meta Developer [App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps){:target=_blank .external-link} and select **Create App**.
2. If you have a business portfolio and you're ready to connect the app to it, select the business portfolio. If you don't have a business portfolio or you're not ready to connect the app to the portfolio, select **I don’t want to connect a business portfolio yet** and select **Next**. The **Use cases** page opens.
3. Select **Other**, then select **Next**.
4. Select **Business** and **Next**.
5. Complete the essential information:
    * Add an **App name**.
    * Add an **App contact email**.
    * Here again you can connect to a business portfolio or skip it.
1. Select **Create app**. The **Add products to your app** page opens.
1. Select **Facebook Login for Business**. The **Settings** page for this product opens.
1. Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from your n8n credential.
1. In your Meta app settings in **Client OAuth settings**, paste that URL as the **Valid OAuth Redirect URIs**.
1. Select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
1. Copy the **App ID** and enter it as the **Client ID** within your n8n credential.
1. Copy the **App Secret** and enter it as the **Client Secret** within your n8n credential.

Your credential should successfully connect now, but you'll need to go through the steps to take your Meta app live before you can use it with the [Facebook Lead Ads trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebookleadadstrigger.md). Here's a summary of what you'll need to do:

1. In your Meta app, select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
1. Enter a **Privacy Policy URL**. (Required to take the app "Live.")
1. Select **Save changes**.
1. At the top of the page, toggle the **App Mode** from **Development** to **Live**.
1. Facebook Login for Business requires Advanced Access for `public_profile`. To add it, go to **App Review > Permissions and Features**.
1. Search for `public_profile` and select **Request advanced access**.
1. Complete the steps for [business verification](https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-verified-for-business/){:target=_blank .external-link}.
1. Use the [Lead Ads Testing Tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing){:target=_blank .external-link} to trigger some demo form submissions and test your workflow.

# FTP credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [FTP](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.ftp.md)

## Prerequisites

Create an account on a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server like [JSCAPE](https://mft.jscape.com/lp/ftp-server){:target=_blank .external-link}, [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/){:target=_blank .external-link}, or [FileZilla Server](https://filezilla-project.org/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Supported authentication methods

- **FTP account**: Use this method if your FTP server doesn't support SSH tunneling or encrypted connections.
- **SFTP account**: Use this method if your FTP server supports SSH tunneling and encrypted connections.

## Related resources

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Secure Shell File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) are protocols for transferring files directly between an FTP/SFTP client and server.

## Using FTP account

Use this method if your FTP server doesn't support SSH tunneling or encrypted connections.

To configure this credential, you'll need to:

1. Enter the name or IP address of your FTP server's **Host**.
2. Enter the **Port** number the connection should use.
3. Enter the **Username** the credential should connect as.
4. Enter the user's **Password**.

Review your FTP server provider's documentation for instructions on getting the information you need.

## Using SFTP account

Use this method if your FTP server supports SSH tunneling and encrypted connections.

To configure this credential, you'll need to:

1. Enter the name or IP address of your FTP server's **Host**.
2. Enter the **Port** number the connection should use.
3. Enter the **Username** the credential should connect as.
4. Enter the user's **Password**.
5. For the **Private Key**, enter a string for either key-based or host-based user authentication
    - Enter your Private Key in OpenSSH format. This is most often generated using the ssh-keygen `-o` parameter, for example: `ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519`.
6. If the **Private Key** is encrypted, enter the **Passphrase** used to decrypt it.
    - If the **Private Key** doesn't use a passphrase, leave this field blank.

Review your FTP server provider's documentation for instructions on getting the information you need.

# GetResponse credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [GetResponse](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.getresponse.md)
- [GetResponse Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.getresponsetrigger.md)

## Prerequisites

Create a [GetResponse](https://www.getresponse.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account.

## Supported authentication methods

- API key
- OAuth2

## Related resources

Refer to [GetResponse's API documentation](https://apidocs.getresponse.com/v3){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API key

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **API Key**: To view or generate an API key, go to **Integrations and API > API**. Refer to the [GetResponse Help Center](https://www.getresponse.com/help/where-do-i-find-the-api-key.html){:target=_blank .external-link} for more detailed instructions.

## Using OAuth2

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**: Generated when you [register your application](https://apidocs.getresponse.com/v3/authentication/oauth2){:target=_blank .external-link}.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated when you [register your application](https://apidocs.getresponse.com/v3/authentication/oauth2){:target=_blank .external-link} as the **Client Secret Key**.

When you register your application, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from n8n and add it as the **Redirect URL** in GetResponse.

/// note | Redirect URL with localhost
The Redirect URL should be a URL in your domain, for example: `https://mytemplatemaker.example.com/gr_callback`. GetResponse doesn't accept a localhost callback URL. Refer to the [FAQs](#configure-oauth2-credentials-for-a-local-environment) to configure the credentials for the local environment.
///

## Configure OAuth2 credentials for a local environment

GetResponse doesn't accept the localhost callback URL. Follow the steps below to configure the OAuth credentials for a local environment:
1. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} to expose the local server running on port `5678` to the internet. In your terminal, run the following command:
```sh
ngrok http 5678
```
2. Run the following command in a new terminal. Replace `<YOUR-NGROK-URL>` with the URL that you got from the previous step.
```sh
export WEBHOOK_URL=<YOUR-NGROK-URL>
```
3. Follow the [Using OAuth2](#using-oauth2) instructions to configure your credentials, using this URL as your **Redirect URL**.

# Ghost credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Ghost](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.ghost.md)

## Prerequisites

Create a [Ghost](https://ghost.org/){:target=_blank .external-link} account.

## Supported authentication methods

- Admin API key
- Content API key

The keys are generated following the same steps, but the authorization flows and key format are different, so n8n stores the credentials separately. The Content API uses an API key; the Admin API uses an API key to generate a token for authentication.

## Related resources

Refer to Ghost's [Admin API documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/admin-api/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the Admin API service. Refer to Ghost's [Content API documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/content-api/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the Content API service.

## Using Admin API key

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- The **URL** of your Ghost admin domain. Your [admin domain](https://ghost.org/docs/admin-api/#base-url){:target=_blank .external-link} can be different to your main domain and may include a subdirectory. All Ghost(Pro) blogs have a `*.ghost.io` domain as their admin domain and require https.
- An **API Key**: To generate a new API key, create a new Custom Integration. Refer to the [Ghost Admin API Token Authentication Key documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/admin-api/#token-authentication){:target=_blank .external-link} for more detailed instructions. Copy the **Admin API Key** and use this as the **API Key** in the Ghost Admin n8n credential.

## Using Content API key

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- The **URL** of your Ghost admin domain. Your [admin domain](https://ghost.org/docs/content-api/#url){:target=_blank .external-link} can be different to your main domain and may include a subdirectory. All Ghost(Pro) blogs have a `*.ghost.io` domain as their admin domain and require https.
- An **API Key**: To generate a new API key, create a new Custom Integration. Refer to the [Ghost Content API Key documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/content-api/#key){:target=_blank .external-link} for more detailed instructions. Copy the **Content API Key** and use this as the **API Key** in the Ghost Content n8n credential.

# GitHub credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [GitHub](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.github.md)
- [GitHub Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.githubtrigger.md)
- [GitHub Document Loader](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentgithubloader.md): this node doesn't support OAuth.

## Prerequisites

Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account.

## Supported authentication methods

- API access token: Use this method with any GitHub nodes.
- OAuth2: Use this method with [GitHub](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.github.md) and [GitHub Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.githubtrigger.md) nodes only; don't use with [GitHub Document Loader](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentgithubloader.md).

## Related resources

Refer to [GitHub's API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API access token

To configure this credential, you'll need a [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account.

There are two steps to setting up this credential:

1. [Generate a GitHub personal access token](#generate-personal-access-token).
2. [Set up the credential](#set-up-the-credential).

Refer to the sections below for detailed instructions.

### Generate personal access token

/// note | Recommended access token type
n8n recommends using a personal access token (classic). GitHub's fine-grained personal access tokens are still in beta and can't access all endpoints.
///

To generate your personal access token:

1. If you haven't done so already, verify your email address with GitHub. Refer to [Verifying your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/verifying-your-email-address){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
2. Open your GitHub profile [Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile){:target=_blank .external-link}.
3. In the left navigation, select [**Developer settings**](https://github.com/settings/apps){:target=_blank .external-link}.
4. In the left navigation, under **Personal access tokens**, select **Tokens (classic)**.
5. Select **Generate new token > Generate new token (classic)**.
6. Enter a descriptive name for your token in the **Note** field, like `n8n integration`.
7. Select the **Expiration** you'd like for the token, or select **No expiration**.
8. Select **Scopes** for your token. For most of the n8n GitHub nodes, add the `repo` scope.
    - A token without assigned scopes can only access public information.
    - Refer to 
9. Select **Generate token**.
10. Copy the token.

Refer to [Creating a personal access token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information. Refer to [Scopes for OAuth apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on GitHub scopes.

### Set up the credential

Then, in your n8n credential:

1. If you aren't using GitHub Enterprise Server, don't change the **GitHub server** URL.
    - If you're using [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.9/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-server){:target=_blank .external-link}, update **GitHub server** to match the URL for your server.
2. Enter your **User** name as it appears in your GitHub profile.
3. Enter the **Access Token** you generated above.

## Using OAuth2

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/cloud-oauth-button.md"

If you're [self-hosting n8n](/hosting/index.md), create a new GitHub [OAuth app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps){:target=_blank .external-link}:

1. Open your GitHub profile [Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. In the left navigation, select [**Developer settings**](https://github.com/settings/apps){:target=_blank .external-link}.
3. In the left navigation, select **OAuth apps**.
4. Select **New OAuth App**.
    - If you haven't created an app before, you may see **Register a new application** instead. Select it.
5. Enter an **Application name**, like `n8n integration`.
6. Enter the **Homepage URL** for your app's website.
7. If you'd like, add the optional **Application description**, which GitHub displays to end-users.
8. From n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** and paste it into the GitHub **Authorization callback URL**.
9. Select **Register application**.
10. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** this generates and add them to your n8n credential.

Refer to the [GitHub Authorizing OAuth apps documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/using-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on the authorization process.

# Google: OAuth2 generic

This document contains instructions for creating a generic OAuth2 Google credential for use with [custom operations](/integrations/custom-operations.md).

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/managed-google-oauth.md"

## Prerequisites

* Create a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) account.

## Set up OAuth

There are five steps to connecting your n8n credential to Google services:

1. [Create a Google Cloud Console project](#create-a-google-cloud-console-project).
1. [Enable APIs](#enable-apis).
1. [Configure your OAuth consent screen](#configure-your-oauth-consent-screen).
1. [Create your Google OAuth client credentials](#create-your-google-oauth-client-credentials).
1. [Finish your n8n credential](#finish-your-n8n-credential).

### Create a Google Cloud Console project

First, create a Google Cloud Console project. If you already have a project, jump to the [next section](#enable-apis):

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/create-google-cloud-project.md"

### Enable APIs

With your project created, enable the APIs you'll need access to:

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/enable-apis.md"

### Configure your OAuth consent screen

If you haven't used OAuth in your Google Cloud project before, you'll need to [configure the OAuth consent screen](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent):

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.
	<figure markdown="span">
	![The project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation](/_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png)
	<figcaption>Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation</figcaption>
	</figure>
1. Open the left navigation menu and go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
1. Select **Get started** to begin configuring OAuth consent.
1. Enter an **App name** and **User support email** to include on the Oauth screen.
1. For the **Audience**, select **Internal** for user access within your organization's Google workspace or **External** for any user with a Google account. Refer to Google's [User type documentation](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/15549945?sjid=17061891731152303663-EU#user-type) for more information on user types.
1. Select the **Email addresses** Google should use to contact you about changes to your project.
1. Read and accept the Google's User Data Policy and select **Create**.
1. In the left-hand menu, select **Branding**.
1. In the **Authorized domains** section, select **Add domain**:
	* If you're using n8n's Cloud service, add `n8n.cloud`
	* If you're [self-hosting](/hosting/index.md), add the domain of your n8n instance.
1. Select **Save** at the bottom of the page.

### Create your Google OAuth client credentials

Next, create the OAuth client credentials in Google:

1. In the **APIs & Services** section, select [**Credentials**](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
2. Select **+ Create credentials** > **OAuth client ID**.
3. In the **Application type** dropdown, select **Web application**.
4. Google automatically generates a **Name**. Update the **Name** to something you'll recognize in your console.
5. From your n8n credential, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**. Paste it into the **Authorized redirect URIs** in Google Console.
6. Select **Create**.

### Finish your n8n credential

With the Google project and credentials fully configured, finish the n8n credential:

1. From Google's **OAuth client created** modal, copy the **Client ID**. Enter this in your n8n credential.
2. From the same Google modal, copy the **Client Secret**. Enter this in your n8n credential.
3. You must provide the scopes for this credential. Refer to [Scopes](#scopes) for more information. Enter multiple scopes in a space-separated list, for example:
	```
	https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.action.compose
	```
4. In n8n, select **Sign in with Google** to complete your Google authentication.
5. **Save** your new credentials.

</div>

## Scopes

Google services have one or more possible access scopes. A scope limits what a user can do. Refer to [OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes) for a list of scopes for all services.

n8n doesn't support all scopes. When creating a generic Google OAuth2 API credential, you can enter scopes from the **Supported scopes** list below. If you enter a scope that n8n doesn't already support, it won't work.

# Google: OAuth2 single service

This document contains instructions for creating a Google credential for a single service. They're also available as a [video](#video).

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/managed-google-oauth.md"

## Prerequisites

* Create a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) account.

## Set up OAuth

There are five steps to connecting your n8n credential to Google services:

1. [Create a Google Cloud Console project](#create-a-google-cloud-console-project).
1. [Enable APIs](#enable-apis).
1. [Configure your OAuth consent screen](#configure-your-oauth-consent-screen).
1. [Create your Google OAuth client credentials](#create-your-google-oauth-client-credentials).
1. [Finish your n8n credential](#finish-your-n8n-credential).

### Create a Google Cloud Console project

First, create a Google Cloud Console project. If you already have a project, jump to the [next section](#enable-apis):

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/create-google-cloud-project.md"

### Enable APIs

With your project created, enable the APIs you'll need access to:

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/enable-apis.md"

### Configure your OAuth consent screen

If you haven't used OAuth in your Google Cloud project before, you'll need to [configure the OAuth consent screen](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent):

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.
	<figure markdown="span">
	![The project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation](/_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png)
	<figcaption>Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation</figcaption>
	</figure>
1. Open the left navigation menu and go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
1. Select **Get started** to begin configuring OAuth consent.
1. Enter an **App name** and **User support email** to include on the Oauth screen.
1. For the **Audience**, select **Internal** for user access within your organization's Google workspace or **External** for any user with a Google account. Refer to Google's [User type documentation](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/15549945?sjid=17061891731152303663-EU#user-type) for more information on user types.
1. Select the **Email addresses** Google should use to contact you about changes to your project.
1. Read and accept the Google's User Data Policy and select **Create**.
1. In the left-hand menu, select **Branding**.
1. In the **Authorized domains** section, select **Add domain**:
	* If you're using n8n's Cloud service, add `n8n.cloud`
	* If you're [self-hosting](/hosting/index.md), add the domain of your n8n instance.
1. Select **Save** at the bottom of the page.

### Create your Google OAuth client credentials

# Google: Service Account

Using service accounts is more complex than OAuth2. Before you begin:

* Check if your node is [compatible](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/index.md#compatible-nodes) with Service Account.
* Make sure you need to use Service Account. For most use cases, [OAuth2](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/oauth-single-service.md) is a better option.
* Read the Google documentation on [Creating and managing service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Prerequisites

* Create a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/){:targe=_blank .external-link} account.

## Set up Service Account

There are four steps to connecting your n8n credential to a Google Service Account:

1. [Create a Google Cloud Console project](#create-a-google-cloud-console-project).
1. [Enable APIs](#enable-apis).
1. [Set up Google Cloud Service Account](#set-up-google-cloud-service-account).
1. [Finish your n8n credential](#finish-your-n8n-credential).

### Create a Google Cloud Console project

First, create a Google Cloud Console project. If you already have a project, jump to the next section:

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/create-google-cloud-project.md"

### Enable APIs

With your project created, enable the APIs you'll need access to:

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/enable-apis.md"

### Set up Google Cloud Service Account

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library){:target=_blank .external-link}. Make sure you're in the correct project.

	<figure markdown="span">
	![The project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation](/_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png)
	<figcaption>Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation</figcaption>
	</figure>

1. Select the hamburger menu **> APIs & Services > Credentials**. Google takes you to your **Credentials** page.
2. Select **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS > Service account**.
3. Enter a name in **Service account name** and an ID in **Service account ID**. Refer to [Creating a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts?hl=en#creating){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
4. Select **CREATE AND CONTINUE**.
5. Based on your use-case, you may want to **Select a role** and **Grant users access to this service account**  using the corresponding sections.
6. Select **DONE**.
7. Select your newly created service account under the **Service Accounts** section. Open the **KEYS** tab.
8. Select **ADD KEY > Create new key**.
9. In the modal that appears, select **JSON**, then select **CREATE**. Google saves the file to your computer.

### Finish your n8n credential

With the Google project and credentials fully configured, finish the n8n credential:

1. Open the downloaded JSON file.
2. Copy the `client_email` and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Service Account Email**.
3. Copy the `private_key`. Don't include the surrounding `"` marks. Enter this as the **Private Key** in your n8n credential.

	///warning | Older versions of n8n
	If you're running an n8n version older than 0.156.0, replace all instances of `\n` in the JSON file with new lines.
	///

4. **Optional**: Choose if you want to [**Impersonate a User**](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account#delegatingauthority){:target=_blank .external-link} (turned on).
    1. To use this option, you must [Enable domain-wide delegation](#enable-domain-wide-delegation) for the service account as a Google Workspace super admin.
	1. Enter the **Email** of the user you want to impersonate.
5. If you plan to use this credential with the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) node, turn on **Set up for use in HTTP Request node**.
	1. With this setting turned on, you'll need to add **Scope(s)** for the node. n8n prepopulates some scopes. Refer to [OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
6. **Save** your credentials.

## Video

The following video demonstrates the steps described above.

<iframe width="840" height="472.5" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ArXVlpo3y1k" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

## Troubleshooting

### Service Account can't access Google Drive files

A Service Account can't access Google Drive files and folders that weren't shared with its associated user email.

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com){:target=_blank .external-link} and copy your Service Account email.
2. Access your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com){:target=_blank .external-link} and go to the designated file or folder.
3. Right-click on the file or folder and select **Share**.
4. Paste your Service Account email into **Add People and groups**.
5. Select **Editor** for read-write access or **Viewer** for read-only access.

### Enable domain-wide delegation

To impersonate a user with a service account, you must enable domain-wide delegation for the service account.

/// warning | Not recommended
Google recommends you [avoid using domain-wide delegation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices-service-accounts#domain-wide-delegation){:target=_blank .external-link}, as it allows impersonation of any user (including super admins) and can pose a security risk.
///

To delegate domain-wide authority to a service account, you must be a super administrator for the Google Workspace domain. Then:

1. From your Google Workspace domain's [Admin console](https://admin.google.com/){:target=_blank .external-link}, select the hamburger menu, then select **Security > Access and data control > API Controls**.
2. In the **Domain wide delegation** pane, select **Manage Domain Wide Delegation**.
3. Select **Add new**.
4. In the **Client ID** field, enter the service account's **Client ID**. To get the Client ID:
    * Open your Google Cloud Console project, then open the [Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts){:target=_blank .external-link} page.
    * Copy the **OAuth 2 Client ID** and use this as the **Client ID** for the **Domain Wide Delegation**.
5. In the **OAuth scopes** field, enter a list of comma-separate scopes to grant your application access. For example, if your application needs domain-wide full access to the Google Drive API and the Google Calendar API, enter: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`.
6. Select **Authorize**.

It can take from 5 minutes up to 24 hours before you can impersonate all users in your Workspace.

To configure this credential, you'll need to [Install](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/) Home Assistant, create a [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/onboarding) account, and have:

- Your **Host**
- The **Port**
- A Long-Lived **Access Token**

To generate an access token and set up the credential:

1. To generate your **Access Token**, log in to Home Assistant and open your [User profile](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/profile){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. In the **Long-Lived Access Tokens** section, generate a new token.
3. Copy this token and enter it in n8n as your **Access Token**.
4. Enter the URL or IP address of your Home Assistant **Host**, without the `http://` or `https://` protocol, for example `your.awesome.home`.
5. For the **Port**, enter the appropriate port:
	- If you've made no port changes and access Home Assistant at `http://`, keep the default of `8123`.
	- If you've made no port changes and access Home Assistant at `https://`, enter `443`.
	- If you've configured Home Assistant to use a specific port, enter that port.
6. If you've enabled SSL in Home Assistant in the [config.yml map key](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/add-ons/configuration/?_highlight=ssl#add-on-configuration){:target=_blank .external-link}, turn on the **SSL** toggle in n8n. If you're not sure, it's best to turn this setting on if you access your home assistant UI using `https://` instead of `http://`.

# HTTP Request credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md)
- [HTTP Request Tool (legacy)](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest.md)

## Prerequisites

You must use the authentication method required by the app or service you want to query.

If you need to secure the authentication with an SSL certificate, refer to [Provide an SSL certificate](#provide-an-ssl-certificate) for the information you'll need.

## Supported authentication methods

- Predefined credential type
- Basic auth (generic credential type)
- Custom auth (generic credential type)
- Digest auth (generic credential type)
- Header auth (generic credential type)
- Bearer auth (generic credential type)
- OAuth1 (generic credential type)
- OAuth2 (generic credential type)
- Query auth (generic credential type)

Refer to [HTTP authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information relating to generic credential types.

/// note | Predefined credential types
n8n recommends using predefined credential types whenever there's a credential type available for the service you want to connect to. It offers an easier way to set up and manage credentials, compared to configuring generic credentials.

You can use [Predefined credential types](/integrations/custom-operations.md#predefined-credential-types) to perform custom operations with some APIs where n8n has a node for the platform. For example, n8n has an Asana node, and supports using your Asana credentials in the HTTP Request node. Refer to [Custom operations](/integrations/custom-operations.md) for more information.
///

## Using predefined credential type

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/predefined-credential-type-how-to.md"

Refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/custom-operations.md) for more information.

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/generic-auth/basic-auth.md"

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/generic-auth/digest-auth.md"

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/generic-auth/header-auth.md"

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/generic-auth/bearer-auth.md"

## Using OAuth1

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports OAuth1 authentication.

To configure this credential, enter:

- An **Authorization URL**: Also known as the Resource Owner Authorization URI. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/authorize`. The temporary credentials are sent here to prompt a user to complete authorization.
- An **Access Token URL**: This is the URI used for the initial request for temporary credentials. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/request` or `/oauth1/token`.
- A **Consumer Key**: Also known as the client key, like a username. This specifies the `oauth_consumer_key` to use for the call.
- A **Consumer Secret**: Also known as the client secret, like a password.
- A **Request Token URL**: This is the URI used to switch from temporary credentials to long-lived credentials after authorization. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/access`.
- Select the **Signature Method** the auth handshake uses. This specifies the `oauth_signature_method` to use for the call. Options include:
	- **HMAC-SHA1**
	- **HMAC-SHA256**
	- **HMAC-SHA512**

For most OAuth1 integrations, you'll need to configure an app, service, or integration to generate the values for most of these fields. Use the **OAuth Redirect URL** in n8n as the redirect URL or redirect URI for such a service.

Read more about [OAuth1](https://oauth.net/1/){:target=_blank .external-link} and the [OAuth1 authorization flow](https://oauth1.wp-api.org/docs/basics/Auth-Flow.html){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Using OAuth2

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports OAuth2 authentication.

Requirements to configure this credential depend on the **Grant Type** selected. Refer to [OAuth Grant Types](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/) for more information on each grant type.

For most OAuth2 integrations, you'll need to configure an app, service, or integration. Use the **OAuth Redirect URL** in n8n as the redirect URL or redirect URI for such a service.

Read more about [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

### Authorization Code grant type

Use Authorization Code grant type to exchange an authorization code for an access token. The auth flow uses the redirect URL to return the user to the client. Then the application gets the authorization code from the URL and uses it to request an access token. Refer to [Authorization Code Request](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/authorization-code-request/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

To configure this credential, select **Authorization Code** as the **Grant Type**.

Then enter:

- An **Authorization URL**
- An **Access Token URL**
- A **Client ID**: The ID or username to log in with.
- A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in with.
- _Optional:_ Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. If unspecified, the credential will request all scopes available to the client.
- _Optional:_ Some services require more query parameters. If your service does, add them as **Auth URI Query Parameters**.
- An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:
	- **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.
	- **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.
- _Optional:_ Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.

### Client Credentials grant type

Use the Client Credentials grant type when applications request an access token to access their own resources, not on behalf of a user. Refer to [Client Credentials](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

To configure this credential, select **Client Credentials** as the **Grant Type**.

Then enter:

- An **Access Token URL**: The URL to hit to begin the OAuth2 flow. Typically this URL ends in `/token`.
- A **Client ID**: The ID or username to use to log in to the client.
- A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in to the client.
- _Optional:_ Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. Most services don't support scopes for Client Credentials grant types; only enter scopes here if yours does.
- An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:
	- **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.
	- **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.
- _Optional:_ Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.

### PKCE grant type

Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) grant type is an extension to the Authorization Code flow to prevent CSRF and authorization code injection attacks.

To configure this credential, select **PKCE** as the **Grant Type**.

Then enter:

- An **Authorization URL**
- An **Access Token URL**
- A **Client ID**: The ID or username to log in with.
- A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in with.
- _Optional:_ Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. If unspecified, the credential will request all scopes available to the client.
- _Optional:_ Some services require more query parameters. If your service does, add them as **Auth URI Query Parameters**.
- An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:
	- **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.
	- **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.
- _Optional:_ Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.

## Using query auth

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports passing authentication as a single key/value query parameter. (For multiple query parameters, use [Custom Auth](#using-custom-auth).)

To configure this credential, enter:

- A query parameter key or **Name**
- A query parameter **Value**

## Using custom auth

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports passing authentication as multiple key/value query parameters or you need more flexibility than the other generic auth options.

The **Custom Auth** credential expects JSON data to define your credential. You can use `headers`, `qs`, `body` or a mix. Review the examples below to get started.

### Sending two headers
```
{
	"headers": {
		"X-AUTH-USERNAME": "username",
		"X-AUTH-PASSWORD": "password"
	}
}
```

### Body
```
{
	 "body" : {
		"user": "username",
		"pass": "password"
	}
}
```

### Query string
```
{
	"qs": { 
		"appid": "123456",
		"apikey": "my-api-key"
	}
}
```

### Sending header and query string
```
{
	"headers": {
		"api-version": "202404"
	},
	"qs": {
		"apikey": "my-api-key"
	}
}
```

## Provide an SSL certificate

You can send an SSL certificate with your HTTP request. Create the SSL certificate as a separate credential for use by the node:

1. In the HTTP Request node **Settings**, turn on **SSL Certificates**.
2. On the **Parameters** tab, add an existing SSL Certificate credential to **Credential for SSL Certificates** or create a new one.

To configure your SSL Certificates credential, you'll need to add:

- The Certificate Authority **CA** bundle
- The **Certificate** (CRT): May also appear as a Public Key, depending on who your issuing CA was and how they format the cert
- The **Private Key** (KEY)
- _Optional:_ If the **Private Key** is encrypted, enter a **Passphrase** for the private key.

If your SSL certificate is in a single file (such as a `.pfx` file), you'll need to open the file to copy details from it to paste into the appropriate fields:

- Enter the Public Key/CRT as the **Certificate**
- Enter the **Private Key**/KEY in that field

- A **Password**: Either the password you use to check email or an app password. Your provider will tell you whether to use your own password or to generate an app password.
- A **Host**: The IMAP host address for your email provider, often formatted as `imap.<provider>.com`. Check with your provider.
- A **Port** number: The default is port `993`. Use this port unless your provider or email administrator tells you to use something different.

Choose whether to use **SSL/TLS** and whether to **Allow Self-Signed Certificates**.

### Provider instructions

Refer to the quickstart guides for these common email providers.

#### Gmail

Refer to [Gmail](/integrations/builtin/credentials/imap/gmail.md).

# Outlook.com IMAP credentials

Follow these steps to configure the IMAP credentials with an Outlook.com account.

## Set up the credentials

To set up the IMAP credential with Outlook.com account, use these settings:

1. Enter your Outlook.com email address as the **User**.
2. Enter your Outlook.com password as the **Password**.

    /// note | App password
    Outlook.com doesn't require you to use an app password, but if you'd like to for security reasons, refer to [Use an app password](#use-an-app-password).
    ///

3. Enter `outlook.office365.com` as the **Host**.
4. For the **Port**, keep the default port number of `993`.
5. Turn on the **SSL/TLS** toggle.
6. Check with your email administrator about whether to **Allow Self-Signed Certificates**.

Refer to Microsoft's [POP, IMAP, and SMTP settings for Outlook.com](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/pop-imap-and-smtp-settings-for-outlook-com-d088b986-291d-42b8-9564-9c414e2aa040){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information.

## Connection errors

You may receive a connection error if you configured your Outlook.com account as IMAP in multiple email clients. Microsoft is working on a fix for this. For now, try this workaround:

1. Go to [account.live.com/activity](https://account.live.com/activity) and sign in using the email address and password of the affected account.
1. Under **Recent activity**, find the **Session Type** event that matches the most recent time you received the connection error. Select it to expand the details.
1. Select **This was me** to approve the IMAP connection.
1. Retest your n8n credential.

Refer to [What is the Recent activity page?](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/what-is-the-recent-activity-page-23cf5556-4dbe-70da-82c8-bb3a8d8f8016){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on using this page.

# Mattermost credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Mattermost](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mattermost.md)

## Supported authentication methods

- API access token

## Related resources

Refer to [Mattermost's API documentation](https://api.mattermost.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API access token

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Mattermost](https://www.mattermost.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account and:

- A personal **Access Token**
- Your Mattermost **Base URL**.

To set it up:

1. In Mattermost, go to **Profile > Security > Personal Access Tokens**.

    /// warning | No Personal Access Tokens option
    If you don't see the Personal Access Tokens option, refer to the troubleshooting steps in [Enable personal access tokens](#enable-personal-access-tokens) below.
    ///

2. Select **Create Token**.
3. Enter a **Token description**, like `n8n integration`.
4. Select **Save**.
5. Copy the **Token ID** and enter it as the **Access Token** in your n8n credential.
6. Enter your Mattermost URL as the **Base URL**.
7. By default, n8n connects only if SSL certificate validation succeeds. To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.

Refer to the Mattermost [Personal access tokens documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/reference/personal-access-token/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

## Enable personal access tokens

Not seeing the **Personal Access Tokens** option has two possible causes:

- Mattermost doesn't have the personal access tokens integration enabled.
- You're trying to generate a personal access token as a non-admin user who doesn't have permission to generate personal access tokens.

To identify the root cause and resolve it:

1. Log in to Mattermost as an admin.
2. Go to **System Console > Integrations > Integration Management**.
3. Confirm that **Enable personal access tokens** is set to **true**. If it's not, change.
4. Go to **System Console > User Management > Users**.
5. Search for the user account you want to allow to generate personal access tokens.
6. Select the **Actions** dropdown for the user and select **Manage roles**.
7. Check the box for **Allow this account to generate personal access tokens** and **Save**.

Refer to the Mattermost [Personal access tokens documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/reference/personal-access-token/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

## Using OAuth2

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/cloud-oauth-button.md"

Some Microsoft services require extra information for OAuth2. Refer to [Service-specific settings](#service-specific-settings) for more guidance on those services.

For self-hosted users, there are two main steps to configure OAuth2 from scratch:

1. [Register an application](#register-an-application) with the Microsoft Identity Platform.
2. [Generate a client secret](#generate-a-client-secret) for that application.

Follow the detailed instructions for each step below. For more detail on the Microsoft OAuth2 web flow, refer to [Microsoft authentication and authorization basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts){:target=_blank .external-link}. 

### Register an application

Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform:

1. Open the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://aka.ms/appregistrations){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. Select **Register an application**.
3. Enter a **Name** for your app.
4. In **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multi-tenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (for example, Skype, Xbox)**.
5. In **Register an application**:
    1. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from your n8n credential.
    2. Paste it into the **Redirect URI (optional)** field.
    3. Select **Select a platform** > **Web**.
6. Select **Register** to finish creating your application.
7. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and paste it into n8n as the **Client ID**.

Refer to [Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

### Generate a client secret

With your application created, generate a client secret for it:

1. On your Microsoft application page, select **Certificates & secrets** in the left navigation.
1. In **Client secrets**, select **+ New client secret**.
1. Enter a **Description** for your client secret, such as `n8n credential`.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Copy the **Secret** in the **Value** column.
1. Paste it into n8n as the **Client Secret**.
1. If you see other fields in the n8n credential, refer to [Service-specific settings](#service-specific-settings) below for guidance on completing those fields.
1. Select **Connect my account** in n8n to finish setting up the connection.
1. Log in to your Microsoft account and allow the app to access your info.

Refer to Microsoft's [Add credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#add-credentials){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on adding a client secret.

### Service-specific settings

The following services require extra information for OAuth2:

#### Dynamics

Dynamics OAuth2 requires information about your Dynamics domain and region. Follow these extra steps to complete the credential:

1. Enter your Dynamics **Domain**.
2. Select the Dynamics data center **Region** you're within.

Refer to the [Microsoft Datacenter regions documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/new-datacenter-regions){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on the region options and corresponding URLs.

#### Microsoft (general)

The general Microsoft OAuth2 also requires you to provide a space-separated list of **Scope**s for this credential.

Refer to [Scopes and permissions in the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc){:target=_blank .external-link} for a list of possible scopes.

#### Outlook

Outlook OAuth2 supports the credential accessing a user's primary email inbox or a shared inbox. By default, the credential will access a user's primary email inbox. To change this behavior:

1. Turn on **Use Shared Inbox**.
2. Enter the target user's UPN or ID as the **User Principal Name**.

#### SharePoint

SharePoint OAuth2 requires information about your SharePoint **Subdomain**.

To complete the credential, enter the **Subdomain** part of your SharePoint URL. For example, if your SharePoint URL is `https://tenant123.sharepoint.com`, the subdomain is `tenant123`.

## Common issues

Here are the known common errors and issues with Microsoft OAuth2 credentials.

# Microsoft Entra ID credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [Microsoft Entra ID](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftentra.md)

## Prerequisites

- Create a Microsoft Entra ID account or subscription.
- If the user account is managed by a corporate Microsoft Entra account, the administrator account has enabled the option “User can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf” for this user (see the [Microsoft Entra documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/grant-admin-consent)).

Microsoft includes an Entra ID free plan when you create a [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) account.

## Supported authentication methods

- OAuth2

## Related resources

Refer to [Microsoft Entra ID's documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/azure-active-directory) for more information about the service.

## Using OAuth2

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/credentials/cloud-oauth-button.md"

For self-hosted users, there are two main steps to configure OAuth2 from scratch:

1. [Register an application](#register-an-application) with the Microsoft Identity Platform.
2. [Generate a client secret](#generate-a-client-secret) for that application.

Follow the detailed instructions for each step below. For more detail on the Microsoft OAuth2 web flow, refer to [Microsoft authentication and authorization basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). 

### Register an application

Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform:

1. Open the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://aka.ms/appregistrations).
2. Select **Register an application**.
3. Enter a **Name** for your app.
4. In **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multi-tenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (for example, Skype, Xbox)**.
5. In **Register an application**:
    1. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from your n8n credential.
    2. Paste it into the **Redirect URI (optional)** field.
    3. Select **Select a platform** > **Web**.
6. Select **Register** to finish creating your application.
7. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and paste it into n8n as the **Client ID**.

Refer to [Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2) for more information.

### Generate a client secret

With your application created, generate a client secret for it:

1. On your Microsoft application page, select **Certificates & secrets** in the left navigation.
1. In **Client secrets**, select **+ New client secret**.
1. Enter a **Description** for your client secret, such as `n8n credential`.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Copy the **Secret** in the **Value** column.
1. Paste it into n8n as the **Client Secret**.
1. Select **Connect my account** in n8n to finish setting up the connection.
1. Log in to your Microsoft account and allow the app to access your info.

Refer to Microsoft's [Add credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#add-credentials) for more information on adding a client secret.

## Setting custom scopes

Microsoft Entra ID credentials use the following scopes by default:

* [`openid`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc#the-openid-scope)
* [`offline_access`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc#the-offline_access-scope)
* [`AccessReview.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#accessreviewreadwriteall)
* [`Directory.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#directoryreadwriteall)
* [`NetworkAccessPolicy.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#networkaccesspolicyreadwriteall)
* [`DelegatedAdminRelationship.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#delegatedadminrelationshipreadwriteall)
* [`EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#entitlementmanagementreadwriteall)
* [`User.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#userreadwriteall)
* [`Directory.AccessAsUser.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#directoryaccessasuserall)
* [`Sites.FullControl.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#sitesfullcontrolall)
* [`GroupMember.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#groupmemberreadwriteall)

To select different scopes for your credentials, enable the **Custom Scopes** slider and edit the **Enabled Scopes** list. Keep in mind that some features may not work as expected with more restrictive scopes.

# Microsoft SQL credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Microsoft SQL](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftsql.md)

## Prerequisites

Create a user account on a [Microsoft SQL server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/what-is-sql-server){:target=_blank .external-link} database.

## Supported authentication methods

- SQL database connection

## Related resources

Refer to [Microsoft's Connect to SQL Server documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/connect-to-database-engine?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=sqldb#connect-to-sql-server){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about connecting to the service.

## Using SQL database connection

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- The **Server** name
- The **Database** name
- Your **User** account/ID
- Your **Password**
- The **Port** to use for the connection
- The **Domain** name
- Whether to use **TLS**
- Whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**
- The **Connect Timeout**
- The **Request Timeout**
- The **TDS Version** the connection should use

To set up the database connection:

1. Enter the SQL Server Host Name as the **Server**. In an existing SQL Server connection, the host name comes before the instance name in the format `HOSTNAME\INSTANCENAME`. Find the host name:
    - In the **Object Explorer** pane as the top-level object for your database.
    - In the footer of a query window.
    - Viewing the current connection **Properties** and looking for **Name** or **Display Name**.
    - Refer to [Find SQL Server Instance Name | When you're connected to SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/ssms-tricks?view=sql-server-ver16#when-youre-connected-to-sql-server){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information. You can also find the information in the [Error logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/ssms-tricks?view=sql-server-ver16#before-you-connect-to-sql-server){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. Enter the SQL Server Instance Name as the **Database** name. Find this name using the same steps listed above for finding the host name.
    - If you don't see an instance name in any of these places, then your database uses the default `MSSQLSERVER` instance name.
3. Enter your **User** account name or ID.
4. Enter your **Password**.
5. For the **Port**:
    - SQL Server defaults to `1433`.
    - If you can't connect over port 1433, check the [Error logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/ssms-tricks?view=sql-server-ver16#before-you-connect-to-sql-server){:target=_blank .external-link} for the phrase `Server is listening on` to identify the port number you should enter.
6. You only need to enter the **Domain** name if users in multiple domains access your database. Run this SQL query to get the domain name:

    ```sql
    SELECT DEFAULT_DOMAIN()[DomainName];
    ```

7. Select whether to use **TLS**.
8. Select whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**: If turned on, the credential will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.
9. Enter the number of milliseconds n8n should attempt the initial connection to complete before disconnecting as the **Connect Timeout**. Refer to the [SqlConnection.ConnectionTimeout property documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.connectiontimeout){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
    - SQL Server stores this timeout as seconds, while n8n stores it as milliseconds. If you're copying your SQL Server defaults, multiple by 100 before entering the number here.
10. Enter the number of milliseconds n8n should wait on a given request before timing out as the **Request Timeout**. This is basically a query timeout parameter. Refer to [Troubleshoot query time-out errors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/performance/troubleshoot-query-timeouts#explanation){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
11. Select the Tabular Data Stream (TDS) protocol to use from the **TDS Version** dropdown. If the server doesn't support the version you select here, the connection uses a negotiated alternate version. Refer to [Appendix A: Product Behavior](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-tds/135d0ebe-5c4c-4a94-99bf-1811eccb9f4a){:target=_blank .external-link} for a more detailed breakdown of the TDS versions' compatibility with different SQL Server versions and .NET frameworks. Options include:
    - **7_4 (SQL Server 2012 ~ 2019)**: TDS version 7.4.
    - **7_3_B (SQL Server 2008R2)**: TDS version 7.3.B.
    - **7_3_A (SQL Server 2008)**: TDS version 7.3.A.
    - **7_2 (SQL Server 2005)**: TDS version 7.2.
    - **7_1 (SQL Server 2000)**: TDS version 7.1.

# MQTT credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [MQTT](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mqtt.md)
- [MQTT Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mqtttrigger.md)

## Prerequisites

Install an [MQTT broker](https://mqtt.org/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

MQTT provides a list of Servers/Brokers at [MQTT Software](https://mqtt.org/software/){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Supported authentication methods

- Broker connection

## Related resources

Refer to [MQTT's documentation](https://mqtt.org/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the MQTT protocol.

Refer to your broker provider's documentation for more detailed configuration and details.

## Using broker connection

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- Your MQTT broker's **Protocol**
- The **Host**
- The **Port**
- A **Username** and **Password** to authenticate with
- If you're using **SSL**, the relevant certificates and keys

To set things up:

1. Select the broker's **Protocol**, which determines the URL n8n uses. Options include:
    - **Mqtt**: Begin the URL with the standard `mqtt:` protocol.
    - **Mqtts**: Begin the URL with the secure `mqtts:` protocol.
    - **Ws**: Begin the URL with the WebSocket `ws:` protocol.
2. Enter your broker **Host**.
3. Enter the **Port** number n8n should use to connect to the broker host.
4. Enter the **Username** to log into the broker as.
5. Enter that user's **Password**.
6. If you want to receive QoS 1 and 2 messages while offline, turn off the **Clean Session** toggle.
7. Enter a **Client ID** you'd like the credential to use. If you leave this blank, n8n will generate one for you. You can use a fixed or expression-based Client ID.
    - Client IDs can be useful to identify and track connection access. n8n recommends using something with `n8n` in it for easier auditing.
8. If your MQTT broker uses SSL, turn the **SSL** toggle on. Once you turn it on:
    1. Select whether to use **Passwordless** connection with certificates, which is like the SASL mechanism EXTERNAL. If turned on:
        1. Select whether to **Reject Unauthorized Certificate**: If turned off, n8n will connect even if the certificate validation fails.
        2. Add an SSL **Client Certificate**.
        3. Add an SSL **Client Key** for the Client Certificate.
    2. One or more SSL **CA Certificates**.

Refer to your MQTT broker provider's documentation for more detailed configuration instructions.

# MySQL credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [MySQL](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mysql/index.md)
- [Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index.md)

/// note | Agent node users
The Agent node doesn't support SSH tunnels.
///

## Prerequisites

Create a user account on a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} server database.

## Supported authentication methods

- Database connection

## Related resources

Refer to [MySQL's documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using database connection

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- The server **Host**: The database's host name or IP address.
- The **Database** name.
- A **User** name.
- A **Password** for that user.
- The **Port** number used by the MySQL server.
- **Connect Timeout**: The number of milliseconds during the initial database connection before a timeout occurs.
- **SSL**: If your database is using SSL, turn this on and add details for the SSL certificate.
- **SSH Tunnel**: Choose whether to connect over an SSH tunnel. An SSH tunnel lets un-encrypted traffic pass over an encrypted connection and enables authorized remote access to servers protected from outside connections by a firewall.

To set up your database connection credential:

1. Enter your database's hostname as the **Host** in your n8n credential. Run this query to confirm the hostname:

    ```
    SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'hostname';
    ```

2. Enter your database's name as the **Database** in your n8n credential. Run this query to confirm the database name:

    ```
    SHOW DATABASES;
    ```

3. Enter the username of a **User** in the database. This user should have appropriate permissions for whatever actions you want n8n to perform.
4. Enter the **Password** for that user.
5. Enter the **Port** number used by the MySQL server (default is `3306`). Run this query to confirm the port number:

    ```
    SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'port';
    ```

6. Enter the **Connect Timeout** you'd like the node to use. The Connect Timeout is the number of milliseconds during the initial database connection the node should wait before timing out. n8n defaults to `1000` which is the default used by MySQL of 10 seconds. If you want to match your database's `connect_timeout`, run this query to get it, then multiply by 100 before entering it in n8n:

    ```
    SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'connect_timeout';
    ```

7. If your database uses SSL and you'd like to use **SSL** for the connection, turn this option on in the credential. If you turn it on, enter the information from your MySQL SSL certificate in these fields:
    1. Enter the `ca.pem` file contents in the **CA Certificate** field.
    2. Enter the `client-key.pem` file contents in the **Client Private Key** field.
    3. Enter the `client-cert.pem` file contents in the **Client Certificate** field.
8. If you want to use **SSH Tunnel** for the connection, turn this option on in the credential. Otherwise, skip it. If you turn it on:
    1. Select the **SSH Authenticate with** to set the SSH Tunnel type to build:
        - Select **Password** if you want to connect to SSH using a password.
        - Select **Private Key** if you want to connect to SSH using an identity file (private key) and a passphrase. 
    2. Enter the **SSH Host**. n8n uses this host to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.
    3. Enter the **SSH Port**. n8n uses this port to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.
    4. Enter the **SSH User** to connect with. n8n uses this user to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.
    5. If you selected **Password** for **SSH Authenticate with**, add the **SSH Password**.
    6. If you selected **Private Key** for **SSH Authenticate with**:
        1. Add the contents of the **Private Key** or identity file used for SSH. This is the same as using the `ssh-identity-file` option with the `shell-connect()` command in MySQL.
        2. If the **Private Key** was created with a passphrase, enter that **Passphrase**. This is the same as using the `ssh-identity-pass` option with the `shell-connect()` command in MySQL. If the **Private Key** has no passphrase, leave this field blank.

Refer to [MySQL | Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/creating-ssl-rsa-files.html){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on working with SSL certificates in MySQL. Refer to [MySQL | Using an SSH Tunnel](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-connection-ssh.html){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on working with SSH tunnels in MySQL.

# Notion credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Notion](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.notion/index.md)
- [Notion Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.notiontrigger.md)

## Prerequisites

Create a [Notion](https://notion.so){:target=_blank .external-link} account with admin level access.

## Supported authentication methods

- API integration token: Used for internal integrations.
- OAuth2: Used for public integrations.

/// note | Integration type
Not sure which integration type to use? Refer to [Internal vs. public integrations](#internal-vs-public-integrations) below for more information.
///

## Related resources

Refer to [Notion's API documentation](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API integration token

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **Internal Integration Secret**: Generated once you create a Notion integration.

To generate an integration secret, [create a Notion integration](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#create-your-integration-in-notion){:target=_blank .external-link} and grab the integration secret from the **Secrets** tab:

1. Go to your Notion [integration dashboard](https://www.notion.com/my-integrations){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. Select the **+ New integration** button.
3. Enter a **Name** for your integration, for example `n8n integration`. If desired, add a **Logo**.
4. Select **Submit** to create your integration.
5. Open the **Capabilities** tab. Select these capabilities:
    - `Read content`
    - `Update content`
    - `Insert content`
    - `User information without email addresses`
6. Be sure to **Save changes**.
7. Select the **Secrets** tab.
8. Copy the **Internal Integration Token** and add it as your n8n **Internal Integration Secret**.

Refer to the [Internal integration auth flow setup documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#internal-integration-auth-flow-set-up){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about authenticating to the service.

### Share Notion page(s) with the integration

For your integration to interact with Notion, you must [give your integration page permission](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#give-your-integration-page-permissions){:target=_blank .external-link} to interact with page(s) in your Notion workspace:

1. Visit the page in your Notion workspace.
2. Select the triple dot menu at the top right of a page.
3. In **Connections**, select **Connect to**.
4. Use the search bar to find and select your integration from the dropdown list.

Once you share at least one page with the integration, you can start making API requests. If the page isn't shared, any API requests made will respond with an error.

Refer to [Integration permissions](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#integration-permissions){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

## Using OAuth2

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**: Generated once you configure a public integration.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated once you configure a public integration.

You must [create a Notion integration](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#create-your-integration-in-notion){:target=_blank .external-link} and set it to public distribution:

1. Go to your Notion [integration dashboard](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. Select the **+ New integration** button.
3. Enter a **Name** for your integration, for example `n8n integration`. If desired, add a **Logo**.
4. Select **Submit** to create your integration.
5. Open the **Capabilities** tab. Select these capabilities:
    - `Read content`
    - `Update content`
    - `Insert content`
    - `User information without email addresses`
6. Select **Save changes**.
7. Go to the **Distribution** tab.
8. Turn on the **Do you want to make this integration public?** control.
9. Enter your company name and website in the **Organization Information** section.
10. Copy the n8n **OAuth Redirect URL** and add it to as a **Redirect URI** in the Notion integration's **OAuth Domain & URLs** section.
11. Go to the **Secrets** tab.
12. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and add them to your n8n credential.

Refer to Notion's [public integration auth flow setup](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#public-integration-auth-flow-set-up){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about authenticating to the service.

## Internal vs. public integrations

**Internal** integrations are:

* Specific to a single workspace.
* Accessible only to members of that workspace.
* Ideal for custom workspace enhancements.

Internal integrations use a simpler authentication process (the integration secret) and don't require any security review before publishing.

**Public** integrations are:

* Usable across multiple, unrelated Notion workspaces.
* Accessible by any Notion user, regardless of their workspace.
* Ideal for catering to broad use cases.

Public integrations use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication. They require a Notion security review before publishing.

For a more detailed breakdown of the two integration types, refer to Notion's [Internal vs. Public Integrations documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started#internal-vs-public-integrations){:target=_blank .external-link}.

# RabbitMQ credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [RabbitMQ](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.rabbitmq.md)
- [RabbitMQ Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.rabbitmqtrigger.md)

## Supported authentication methods

- User connection

## Related resources

Refer to [RabbitMQ's Connections documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/connections){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using user connection

To configure this credential, you'll need to have a [RabbitMQ broker](https://www.rabbitmq.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} installed and:

1. Enter the **Hostname** for the RabbitMQ broker.
2. Enter the **Port** the connection should use.
3. Enter a **User** the connection should use to log in as.
    - The default is `guest`. RabbitMQ recommends using a different user in production environments. Refer to [Access Control | The Basics](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/access-control#basics){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information. If you're using the `guest` account with a non-localhost connection, refer to [`guest` user issues](#guest-user-issues) below for troubleshooting tips.
4. Enter the user's **Password**.
    - The default password for the `guest` user is `guest`.
5. Enter the [virtual host](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/vhosts){:target=_blank .external-link} the connection should use as the **Vhost**. The default virtual host is `/`.
6. Select whether the connection should use **SSL**. If turned on, also set:
    - **Passwordless**: Select whether the SSL certificate connection users SASL mechanism EXTERNAL (turned off) or doesn't use a password (turned on). If turned on, you'll also need to enter:
        - The **Client Certificate**: Paste the text of the SSL client certificate to use.
        - The **Client Key**: Paste the SSL client key to use.
        - The **Passphrase**: Paste the SSL passphrase to use.
    - **CA Certificates**: Paste the text of the SSL CA certificates to use.

## guest user issues

If you use the `guest` user for the credential and you try to access a remote host, you may see a connection error. The RabbitMQ logs show an error like this:

    [error] <0.918.0> PLAIN login refused: user 'guest' can only connect via localhost

This happens because RabbitMQ prohibits the default `guest` user from connecting from remote hosts. It can only connect over the `localhost`.

To resolve this error, you can:

- Update the `guest` user to allow it remote host access.
- Create or use a different user to connect to the remote host. The `guest` user is the only user limited by default.

Refer to ["guest" user can only connect from localhost](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/access-control#loopback-users){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

## Supported authentication methods

- S3 endpoint

## Related resources

Refer to your S3-compatible provider's documentation for more information on the services. For example, refer to [Wasabi's REST API documentation](https://docs.wasabi.com/docs/rest-api-introduction){:target="_blank" .external-link} or [DigitalOcean's Spaces API Reference Documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/spaces-api/){:target="_blank" .external-link}.

## Using S3 endpoint

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **S3 Endpoint**: Enter the URL endpoint for the S3 storage backend.
- A **Region**: Enter the region for your S3 storage. Some providers call this the "region slug."
- An **Access Key ID**: Enter the S3 access key your S3 provider uses to access the bucket or space. Some providers call this API keys.
- A **Secret Access Key**: Enter the secret access key for the **Access Key ID**.
- **Force Path Style**: When turned on, the connection uses path-style addressing for buckets.
- **Ignore SSL Issues**: When turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.

More detailed instructions for DigitalOcean Spaces and Wasabi follow. If you're using a different provider, refer to their documentation for more information. 

### Using DigitalOcean Spaces

To configure the credential for use with DigitalOcean spaces:

1. In DigitalOceans, go to the control panel and open **Settings**. Your endpoint should be listed there. Prepend `https://` to that endpoint and enter it as the **S3 Endpoint** in n8n.
    - Your DigitalOceans endpoint depends on the data center region your bucket's in.
2. For the **Region**, enter the region your bucket's located in, for example, `nyc3`.
    - If you plan to use this credential to create new Spaces, enter `us-east-1` instead.
3. From your DigitalOceans control panel, go to [**API**](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/spaces){:target="_blank" .external-link}.
4. Open the **Spaces Keys** tab.
5. Select **Generate New Key**.
6. Enter a **Name** for your key, like `n8n integration` and select the checkmark.
7. Copy the **Key** displayed next to the name and enter this as the **Access Key ID** in n8n.
8. Copy the **Secret** value and enter this as the **Secret Access Key** in n8n.
    - Refer to [Sharing Access to Buckets with Access Keys](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/how-to/manage-access/#access-keys){:target="_blank" .external-link} for more information on generating the key and secret.
9. Keep the **Force Path Style** toggle turned off unless you want to use subdomain/virtual calling format.
10. Decide how you want the n8n credential to handle SSL:
    - To respect SSL certificate validation, keep the default of **Ignore SSL Issues** turned off.
    - To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.

Refer to DigitalOcean's [Spaces API Reference Documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/spaces-api/){:target="_blank" .external-link} for more information.

### Using Wasabi

To configure the credential for use with Wasabi:

1. For the **S3 Endpoint**, enter the service URL for your bucket's region. Start it with `https://`.
    - Refer to [What are the service URLs for Wasabi's different storage regions?](https://knowledgebase.wasabi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015106031-What-are-the-service-URLs-for-Wasabi-s-different-storage-regions){:target="_blank" .external-link} to identify the correct URL.
2. For the **Region**, enter the region slug portion of the service URL. For example, if you entered `https://s3.us-east-2.wasabisys.com` as the **S3 Endpoint**, `us-east-2` is the region.
3. Log into you Wasabi Console as the root user.
4. Open the **Menu** and select **Access Keys**.
5. Select **CREATE NEW ACCESS KEY**.
6. Select whether the key is for the **Root User** or a **Sub-User** and select **CREATE**.
7. Copy the **Access Key** and enter it in n8n as the **Access Key ID**.
8. Copy the **Secret Key** and enter it in n8n as the **Secret Access Key**.
    - Refer to [Creating a Wasabi API Access Key Set](https://knowledgebase.wasabi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019677192-Creating-a-Wasabi-API-Access-Key-Set){:target="_blank" .external-link} for more information on generating the key and secret.
9. Wasabi recommends turning on the **Force Path Style** toggle "because the path-style offers the greatest flexibility in bucket names, avoiding domain name issues." Refer to the Wasabi [REST API Introduction](https://docs.wasabi.com/docs/rest-api-introduction){:target="_blank" .external-link} for more information.
10. Decide how you want the n8n credential to handle SSL:
    - To respect SSL certificate validation, keep the default of **Ignore SSL Issues** turned off.
    - To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.

# Salesforce credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Salesforce](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.salesforce.md)
- [Salesforce trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.salesforcetrigger.md)

## Supported authentication methods

- JWT
- OAuth2

## Related resources

Refer to [Salesforce's developer documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_intro.htm){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using JWT

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account and:

- Your **Environment Type** (Production or Sandbox)
- A **Client ID**: Generated when you create a connected app.
- Your Salesforce **Username**
- A **Private Key** for a self-signed digital certificate

To set things up, first you'll create a private key and certificate, then a connected app:

1. In n8n, select the **Environment Type** for your connection. Choose the option that best describes your environment from **Production** or **Sandbox**.
2. Enter your Salesforce **Username**.
1. Log in to your org in Salesforce.
2. You'll need a private key and certificate issued by a certification authority. Use your own key/cert or use OpenSSL to create a key and a self-signed digital certificate. Refer to the Salesforce [Create a Private Key and Self-Signed Digital Certificate documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_auth_key_and_cert.htm){:target=_blank .external-link} for instructions on creating your own key and certificate.
3. From **Setup** in Salesforce, enter `App Manager` in the Quick Find box, then select **App Manager**.
3. On the App Manager page, select **New Connected App**.
4. Enter the required **Basic Info** for your connected app, including a **Name** and **Contact Email address**. Refer to Salesforce's [Configure Basic Connected App Settings](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create_basics.htm&type=5){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more information.
5. Check the box to **Enable OAuth Settings**.
6. For the **Callback URL**, enter `http://localhost:1717/OauthRedirect`.
7. Check the box to **Use digital signatures**.

# Send Email credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Send Email](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sendemail.md)

## Prerequisites

- Create an email account on a service that supports SMTP.
- Some email providers require that you enable or set up outgoing SMTP or generate an app password. Refer to your provider's documentation to see if there are other required steps.

## Supported authentication methods

- SMTP account

## Related resources

Simple Message Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a standard protocol for sending and receiving email. Most email providers offer instructions on setting up their service with SMTP. Refer to your provider's SMTP instructions.

## Using SMTP account

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **User** email address
- A **Password**: This may be the user's password or an app password. Refer to the documentation for your email provider.
- The **Host**: The SMTP host address for your email provider, often formatted as `smtp.<provider>.com`. Check with your provider.
- A **Port** number: The default is port `465`, commonly used for SSL. Other common ports are `587` for TLS or `25` for no encryption. Check with your provider.
- **SSL/TLS**: When turned on, SMTP will use SSL/TLS.
- **Disable STARTTLS**: When SSL/TLS is disabled, the SMTP server can still try to [upgrade the TCP connection using STARTTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS){:target=_blank .external-link}. Turning this on prevents that behaviour.
- **Client Host Name**: If needed by your provider, add a client host name. This name identifies the client to the server.

### Provider instructions

Refer to the quickstart guides for these common email providers.

#### Gmail

Refer to [Gmail](/integrations/builtin/credentials/sendemail/gmail.md).

#### Outlook.com

Refer to [Outlook.com](/integrations/builtin/credentials/sendemail/outlook.md).

#### Yahoo

Refer to [Yahoo](/integrations/builtin/credentials/sendemail/yahoo.md).

### My provider isn't listed

If your email provider isn't listed here, search for `SMTP settings` to find their instructions. (These instructions may also be included with `IMAP settings` or `POP settings`.)

- Your **Shop Subdomain**: Your subdomain is within the URL: `https://<subdomain>.myshopify.com`. For example, if the full URL is `https://n8n.myshopify.com`, the Shop Subdomain is `n8n`.
- _Optional:_ A **Shared Secret**

## Common issues

Here are some common issues setting up the Shopify credential and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Enable custom app development

If you don't see the option to **Create a custom app**, no one's enabled custom app development for your store.

To enable custom app development, you must log in either as a store owner or as a user with the **Enable app development** permission:

1. In Shopify, go to **Admin > Settings >** [**Apps and sales channels**](https://admin.shopify.com/settings/apps){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. Select **Develop apps**.
3. Select **Allow custom app development**.
4. Read the warning and information provided and select **Allow custom app development**.

### Forbidden credentials error

<!-- vale off -->
If you get a **Couldn't connect with these settings / Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials** warning when you test the credentials, this may be due to your app's [access scope](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes){:target=_blank .external-link} dependencies. For example, the `read_orders` scope also requires `read_products` scope. Review the scopes you have assigned and the action you're trying to complete.

Refer to the Slack [Installing with OAuth](https://api.slack.com/authentication/oauth-v2){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for more details on the OAuth flow itself.

## Scopes

Scopes determine what permissions an app has.

* If you want your app to act on behalf of users who authorize the app, add the required scopes under the **User Token Scopes** section.
* If you're building a bot, add the required scopes under the **Bot Token Scopes** section.

Here's the list of scopes the OAuth credential requires, which are a good starting point:

| **Scope name** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- |
| `channels:read` | |
| `channels:write` | Not available as a bot token scope |

## Using database connection

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **Account** name: Your account name is the string of characters located between `https://` and `snowflakecomputing.com` in your Snowflake URL. For example, if the URL of your Snowflake account is `https://abc.eu-central-1.snowflakecomputing.com` then the name of your account is `abc.eu-central-1`.
- A **Database**: Enter the name of the [database](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/use-database){:target=_blank .external-link} the credential should connect to.
- A **Warehouse**: Enter the name of the default virtual [warehouse](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/use-warehouse){:target=_blank .external-link} to use for the session after connecting. n8n uses this warehouse for performing queries, loading data, and so on.
- A **Username**
- A **Password**
- A **Schema**: Enter the [schema](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/use-schema){:target=_blank .external-link} you want to use after connecting.

# Strapi credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Strapi](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.strapi.md)

## Prerequisites

Create a [Strapi](https://strapi.io/){:target=_blank .external-link} admin account with:

- Access to an existing Strapi project.
- At least one collection type within that project.
- Published data within that collection type.

Refer to the Strapi developer [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/quick-start){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

## Supported authentication methods

- API user account: Requires a user account with appropriate content permissions.
- API token: Requires an admin account.

## Related resources

Refer to [Strapi's documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/api/rest){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API user account

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A user **Email**: Must be for a user account, not an admin account. Refer to the more detailed instructions below.
- A user **Password**: Must be for a user account, not an admin account. Refer to the more detailed instructions below.
- The **URL**: Use the public URL of your Strapi server, defined in `./config/server.js` as the `url` parameter. Strapi recommends using an absolute URL.
    - For Strapi Cloud projects, use the URL of your Cloud project, for example: `https://my-strapi-project-name.strapiapp.com`
- The **API Version**: Select the version of the API you want your calls to use. Options include:
    - **Version 3**
    - **Version 4**

In Strapi, the configuration involves two steps:

1. [Configure a role](#configure-a-role).
2. [Create a user account](#create-a-user-account).

Refer to the more detailed instructions below for each step.

### Configure a role

For API access, use the Users & Permissions Plugin in **Settings > Users & Permissions Plugin**.

Refer to [Configuring Users & Permissions Plugin](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/settings/configuring-users-permissions-plugin-settings){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on the plugin. Refer to [Configuring end-user roles](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-end-users-roles){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on roles.

For the n8n credential, the user must have a role that grants them API permissions on the collection type. For the role, you can either:

* Update the default **Authenticated** role to include the permissions and assign the user to that role. Refer to [Configuring role's permissions](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-end-users-roles#configuring-roles-permissions){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
* Create a new role to include the permissions and assign the user to that role. Refer to [Creating a new role](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-end-users-roles#creating-a-new-role){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

For either option, once you open the role:

1. Go to the **Permissions** section.
2. Open the section for the relevant collection type.
3. Select the permissions for the collection type that the role should have. Options include:
    - `create` (POST)
    - `find` and `findone` (GET)
    - `update` (PUT)
    - `delete` (DELETE)
4. Repeat for all relevant collection types.
5. Save the role.

Refer to [Endpoints](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/api/rest#endpoints){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on the permission options.

### Create a user account

Now that you have an appropriate role, create an end-user account and assign the role to it:

1. Go to **Content Manager > Collection Types > User**.
2. Select **Add new entry**.
3. Fill in the user details. The n8n credential requires these fields, though your Strapi project may have more custom required fields:
    - **Username**: Required for all Strapi users.
    - **Email**: Enter in Strapi and use as the **Email** in the n8n credential.
    - **Password**: Enter in Strapi and use as the **Password** in the n8n credential.
    - **Role**: Select the role you set up in the previous step.

Refer to [Managing end-user accounts](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/managing-end-users){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.


## Using API token

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **API Token**: Create an API token from **Settings > Global Settings > API Tokens**. Refer to Strapi's [Creating a new API token documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/settings/API-tokens#creating-a-new-api-token){:target=_blank .external-link} for more details and information on regenerating API tokens.
    
    /// note | API tokens permission
    If you don't see the **API tokens** option in **Global settings**, your account doesn't have the **API tokens > Read** permission.
    ///
    
- The **URL**: Use the public URL of your Strapi server, defined in `./config/server.js` as the `url` parameter. Strapi recommends using an absolute URL.
    - For Strapi Cloud projects, use the URL of your Cloud project, for example: `https://my-strapi-project-name.strapiapp.com`
- The **API Version**: Select the version of the API you want your calls to use. Options include:
    - **Version 3**
    - **Version 4**

- [Strava](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.strava.md)
- [Strava Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stravatrigger.md)

## Prerequisites

- Create a [Strava](https://strava.com){:target=_blank .external-link} account.
- Create a Strava application in [**Settings > API**](https://www.strava.com/settings/api){:target=_blank .external-link}. Refer to [Using OAuth2](#using-oauth2) for more information.

## Supported authentication methods

- OAuth2

## Related resources

Refer to [Strava's API documentation](https://developers.strava.com/docs/reference/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using OAuth2

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**: Generated when you [create a Strava app](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/#account){:target=_blank .external-link}.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated when you [create a Strava app](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/#account){:target=_blank .external-link}.

Use these settings for your Strava app:

- In n8n, copy the **OAuth Callback URL**. Paste this URL into your Strava app's **Authorization Callback Domain**.
- Remove the protocol (`https://` or `http://`) and the relative URL (`/oauth2/callback` or `/rest/oauth2-credential/callback`) from the **Authorization Callback Domain**. For example, if the OAuth Redirect URL was originally `https://oauth.n8n.cloud/oauth2/callback`, the **Authorization Callback Domain** would be `oauth.n8n.cloud`.
- Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your app and add them to your n8n credential.

Refer to [Authentication](https://developers.strava.com/docs/authentication/){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about Strava's OAuth flow.

- [Stripe Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stripetrigger.md)
- [Stripe](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stripe.md)

## Supported authentication methods

- API key

## Related resources

Refer to [Stripe's API documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/api){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API key

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Stripe](https://stripe.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} admin or developer account and:

- An API **Secret Key**

Before you generate an API key, decide whether to generate it in live mode or test mode. Refer to [Test mode and live mode](#test-mode-and-live-mode) for more information about the two modes.

### Live mode Secret key

To generate a Secret key in live mode:

1. Open the [Stripe developer dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/developers){:target=_blank .external-link} and select [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. In the **Standard Keys** section, select **Create secret key**.
3. Enter a **Key name**, like `n8n integration`.
4. Select **Create**. The new API key displays.
4. Copy the key and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Secret Key**.

Refer to Stripe's [Create a secret API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#create-api-secret-key){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

### Test mode Secret key

To use a Secret key in test mode, you must copy the existing one:

1. Go to your [Stripe test mode developer dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/developers){:target=_blank .external-link} and select [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys){:target=_blank .external-link}.
2. In the **Standard Keys** section, select **Reveal test key** for the **Secret key**.
3. Copy the key and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Secret Key**.

Refer to Stripe's [Create a secret API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#create-api-secret-key){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

## Test mode and live mode

All Stripe API requests happen within either [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode) or live mode. Each mode has its own API key. 

Use test mode to access simulated test data and live mode to access actual account data. Objects in one mode aren’t accessible to the other.

Refer to [API keys | Test mode versus live mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about what's available in each mode and guidance on when to use each.

/// note | n8n credentials for both modes
If you want to work with both live mode and test mode keys, store each mode's key in a separate n8n credential.
///

## Key prefixes

Stripes' Secret keys always begin with `sk_`:

- Live keys begin with `sk_live_`.
- Test keys begin with `sk_test_`.

n8n hasn't tested these credentials with Restricted keys (prefixed `rk_`).

/// warning | Publishable keys
Don't use the Publishable keys (prefixed `pk_`) with your n8n credential.
///

## Related resources

Refer to [SurveyMonkey's API documentation](https://developer.surveymonkey.com/api/v3/#SurveyMonkey-Api){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API access token

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **Access Token**: Generated once you create an app.
- A **Client ID**: Generated once you create an app.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated once you create an app.

Once you've created your app and assigned appropriate scopes, go to **Settings > Credentials**. Copy the **Access Token**, **Client ID**, and **Secret** and add them to n8n.

## Using OAuth

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**: Generated once you create an app.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated once you create an app.

Once you've created your app and assigned appropriate scopes:

1. Go to the app's **Settings > Settings**.
2. From n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**.
3. Overwrite the app's existing **OAuth Redirect URL** with that URL.
4. Select **Submit Changes**.
5. Be sure the **Scopes** section contains the [Required app scopes](#required-app-scopes).

From the app's **Settings > Credentials**, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and add them to your n8n credential. You can now select **Connect my account** from n8n.

/// note | SurveyMonkey Test OAuth Flow
This option only works if you keep the default SurveyMonkey **OAuth Redirect URL** and add the n8n OAuth Redirect URL as an **Additional Redirect URL**.
///

## Required app scopes

Once you create your app, go to **Settings > Scopes**. Select these scopes for your n8n credential to work:

- **View Surveys**
- **View Collectors**
- **View Responses**
- **View Response Details**
- **Create/Modify Webhooks**
- **View Webhooks**

Select **Update Scopes** to save them.

# Twist credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Twist](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.twist.md)

## Prerequisites

- Create a [Twist](https://twist.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account.
- [Create a general integration](https://twist.com/app_console/create_app){:target=_blank .external-link} and configure a valid OAuth Redirect URL. Refer to [Using OAuth2](#using-oauth2) for more information.

## Supported authentication methods

- OAuth2

## Related resources

Refer to [Twist's API documentation](https://developer.twist.com/v3/#authorization){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about authenticating with the service.

## Using OAuth2
To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**: Generated once you create a general integration.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated once you create a general integration.

To generate your Client ID and Client Secret, [create a general integration](https://twist.com/app_console/create_app){:target=_blank .external-link}.

Use these settings for your integration's **OAuth Authentication**:

- Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from n8n and enter it as the **OAuth 2 redirect URL** in Twist.
    
    /// note | OAuth Redirect URL for self-hosted n8n
    Twist doesn't accept a `localhost` Redirect URL. The Redirect URL should be a URL in your domain, for example: `https://mytemplatemaker.example.com/gr_callback`. If your n8n **OAuth Redirect URL** contains localhost, refer below to [Local environment redirect URL](#local-environment-redirect-url) for generating a URL that Twist will allow.
    ///

- Select **Update OAuth settings** to save those changes.
- Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Twist and enter them in the appropriate fields in n8n.

### Local environment redirect URL

Twist doesn't accept a localhost callback URL. These steps should allow you to configure the OAuth credentials for the local environment:

1. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose the local server running on port `5678` to the internet. In your terminal, run the following command:
```sh
ngrok http 5678
```
2. Run the following command in a new terminal. Replace `<YOUR-NGROK-URL>` with the URL that you get from the previous step.
```sh
export WEBHOOK_URL=<YOUR-NGROK-URL>
```
3. Use the generated URL as your **OAuth 2 redirect URL** in Twist.

# X (formerly Twitter) credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [X (formerly Twitter)](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.twitter.md)

## Prerequisites

- Create an [X developer](https://developer.x.com/en){:target=_blank .external-link} account.
- Create a [Twitter app](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/apps){:target=_blank .external-link} or use the default project and app created when you sign up for the developer portal. Refer to each supported authentication method below for more details on the app's configuration.

## Supported authentication methods

- OAuth2

/// note | Deprecation warning
n8n used to support an **OAuth** authentication method, which used X's [OAuth 1.0a](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a){:target=_blank .external-link} authentication method. n8n deprecated this method with the release of V2 of the X node in n8n version [0.236.0](/release-notes/0-x.md#n8n02360).
///

## Related resources

Refer to [X's API documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service. Refer to [X's API authentication documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/overview){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about authenticating with the service.

Refer to [Application-only Authentication](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about app-only authentication.

## Using OAuth2

Use this method if you're using n8n version 0.236.0 or later.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**
- A **Client Secret**

To generate your Client ID and Client Secret:

1. In the Twitter [developer portal](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard){:target=_blank .external-link}, open your project.
2. On the project's **Overview** tab, find the **Apps** section and select **Add App**.
3. Give your app a **Name** and select **Next**.
1. Go to the **App Settings**.
4. In the **User authentication settings**, select **Set Up**.
1. Set the **App permissions**. Choose **Read and write and Direct message** if you want to use all functions of the n8n X node.
5. In the **Type of app** section, select **Web App, Automated App or Bot**.
1. In n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**.
7. In your X app, find the **App Info** section and paste that URL in as the **Callback URI / Redirect URL**.
7. Add a **Website URL**.
8. Save your changes.
1. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** displayed in X and add them to the corresponding fields in your n8n credential.

Refer to X's [OAuth 2.0 Authentication documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information on working with this authentication method.

/// note | X rate limits
This credential uses the OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token authentication method, so you'll be subject to app rate limits. Refer to [X rate limits](#x-rate-limits) below for more information.
///

## X rate limits

X has time-based rate limits per endpoint based on your developer access plan level. X calculates app rate limits and user rate limits independently. Refer to [Rate limits](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits){:target=_blank .external-link} for the access plan level rate limits and guidance on avoiding hitting them.

Use the guidance below for calculating rate limits:

- If you're using the deprecated OAuth method, user rate limits apply. You'll have one limit per time window for each set of users' access tokens.
- If you're [Using OAuth2](#using-oauth2), app rate limits apply. You'll have a limit per time window for requests made by your app.

X calculates user rate limits and app rate limits independently.

Refer to X's [Rate limits and authentication methods](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits#auth){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about these rate limit types.

- [Wise](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wise.md)
- [Wise Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wisetrigger.md)

## Prerequisites

Create a [Wise](https://wise.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account.

## Supported authentication methods

- API token

## Related resources

Refer to [Wise's API documentation](https://docs.wise.com/api-docs/api-reference){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API token

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **API Token**: Go to your **user menu > Settings > API tokens** to generate an API token. Enter the generated API key in your n8n credential. Refer to [Getting started with the API](https://wise.com/help/articles/2958107/getting-started-with-the-api){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

    - If you're using a Wise test sandbox account, select **Test**.
    - Otherwise, select **Live**.
- **Private Key (Optional)**: For live endpoints requiring Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), generate a public and private key. Enter the private key here. Refer to [Add a private key](#add-a-private-key) for more information.
    - If you're using a **Test** environment, you'll only need to enter a Private Key if you've enabled Strong Customer Authentication on the [public keys management page](https://sandbox.transferwise.tech/public-keys){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Add a private key

Wise protects some live endpoints and operations with Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). Refer to [Strong Customer Authentication & 2FA](https://docs.wise.com/api-docs/features/strong-customer-authentication-2fa){:target=_blank .external-link} for details.

If you make a request to an endpoint that requires SCA, Wise returns a 403 Forbidden HTTP status code. The error returned will look like this:

> This request requires Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). Please add a key pair to your account and n8n credentials. See https://api-docs.transferwise.com/#strong-customer-authentication-personal-token

To use endpoints requiring SCA, generate an RSA key pair and add the relevant key information to both Wise and n8n:

1. Generate an RSA key pair:

    ```sh
    $ openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048 
    $ openssl rsa -pubout -in private.pem -out public.pem
    ```

2. Add the content of the public key `public.pem` to your Wise **user menu > Settings > API tokens > Manage public keys**.
3. Add the content of the private key `private.pem` in n8n to the **Private Key (Optional)**.

Refer to [Personal Token SCA](https://docs.wise.com/api-docs/features/strong-customer-authentication-2fa/personal-token-sca){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.

# Built-in integrations

This section contains the [node](/glossary.md#node-n8n) library: reference documentation for every built-in node in n8n, and their credentials.

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/node-operations.md"

## Core nodes

Core nodes can be actions or [triggers](/glossary.md#trigger-node-n8n). Whereas most nodes connect to a specific external service, core nodes provide functionality such as logic, scheduling, or generic API calls.

## Cluster nodes

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/cluster-nodes-summary.md"

## Credentials

External services need a way to identify and authenticate users. This data can range from an API key over an email/password combination to a long multi-line private key. You can save these in n8n as [credentials](/glossary.md#credential-n8n).

Nodes in n8n can then request that credential information. As another layer of security, only node types with specific access rights can access the credentials.

To make sure that the data is secure, it gets saved to the database encrypted. n8n uses a random personal encryption key, which it automatically generates on the first run of n8n and then saved under `~/.n8n/config`.

To learn more about creating, managing, and sharing credentials, refer to [Manage credentials](/credentials/index.md).

## Community nodes

n8n supports custom nodes built by the community. Refer to [Community nodes](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/index.md) for guidance on installing and using these nodes.

For help building your own custom nodes, and publish them to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/){:target=_blank .external-link}, refer to [Creating nodes](/integrations/creating-nodes/overview.md) for more information.

title: Handling API rate limits
contentType: howto
description: How to handle API rate limits when using n8n integrations.
---

# Handling API rate limits

[API](/glossary.md#api) rate limits are restrictions on request frequency. For example, an API may limit the number of requests you can make per minute, or per day.

APIs can also limits how much data you can send in one request, or how much data the API sends in a single response.

## Identify rate limit issues

When an n8n node hits a rate limit, it errors. n8n displays the error message in the node output panel. This includes the error message from the service.

If n8n received error 429 (too many requests) from the service, the error message is **The service is receiving too many requests from you**.

To check the rate limits for the service you're using, refer to the API documentation for the service.

## Handle rate limits for integrations

There are two ways to handle rate limits in n8n's integrations: using the Retry On Fail setting, or using a combination of the [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches.md) and [Wait](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait.md) nodes: 

* Retry On Fail adds a pause between API request attempts.
* With Loop Over Items and Wait you can break you request data into smaller chunks, as well as pausing between requests.

### Enable Retry On Fail

When you enable Retry On Fail, the node automatically tries the request again if it fails the first time.

1. Open the node.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Enable the **Retry On Fail** toggle.
1. Configure the retry settings: if using this to work around rate limits, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to more than the rate limit. For example, if the API you're using allows one request per second, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000` to allow a 1 second wait.

### Use Loop Over Items and Wait

Use the Loop Over Items node to batch the input items, and the Wait node to introduce a pause between each request.

1. Add the Loop Over Items node before the node that calls the API. Refer to [Loop Over Items](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches.md) for information on how to configure the node.
1. Add the Wait node after the node that calls the API, and connect it back to the Loop Over Items node. Refer to [Wait](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait.md) for information on how to configure the node.

For example, to handle rate limits when using OpenAI:

!["Screenshot of a workflow using the Loop Over Items node and Wait node to handle API rate limits for the OpenAI APIs"](/_images/integrations/builtin/rate-limits/loop-wait.png)

## Handle rate limits in the HTTP Request node

The HTTP Request node has built-in settings for handling rate limits and large amounts of data.

### Batch requests

Use the Batching option to send more than one request, reducing the request size, and introducing a pause between requests. This is the equivalent of using Loop Over Items and Wait.

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option** > **Batching**.
1. Set **Items per Batch**: this is the number of input items to include in each request.
1. Set **Batch Interval (ms)** to introduce a delay between requests. For example, if the API you're using allows one request per second, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000` to allow a 1 second wait.

### Paginate results

APIs paginate their results when they need to send more data than they can handle in a single response. For more information on pagination in the HTTP Request node, refer to [HTTP Request node | Pagination](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md#pagination).

# Airtable Trigger node

[Airtable](https://airtable.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} is a spreadsheet-database hybrid, with the features of a database but applied to a spreadsheet. The fields in an Airtable table are similar to cells in a spreadsheet, but have types such as 'checkbox', 'phone number', and 'drop-down list', and can reference file attachments like images.

On this page, you'll find a list of events the Airtable Trigger node can respond to and links to more resources.

/// note | Credentials

## Events

* **New Airtable event**

## Related resources

n8n provides an app node for Airtable. You can find the node docs [here](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/index.md).

View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/airtable-trigger/) on n8n's website.

Refer to [Airtable's documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction) for details about their API.

## Node parameters

Use these parameters to configure your node.

### Poll Times

n8n's Airtable node uses polling for check for updates on configured Airtable resources. The **Poll Times** parameter configures the querying frequency:

* Every Minute
* Every Hour
* Every Day
* Every Week
* Every Month
* Every X: Check for updates every given number of minutes or hours.
* Custom: Customize the polling interval by providing a [cron expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).

Use the **Add Poll Time** button to add more polling intervals.

### Base

The [Airtable base](https://support.airtable.com/docs/airtable-bases-overview) you want to check for updates on. You can provide your base's URL or [base ID](https://support.airtable.com/docs/finding-airtable-ids#finding-base-table-and-view-ids-from-urls).

### Table

The [Airtable table](https://support.airtable.com/docs/tables-overview) within the Airtable base that you want to check for updates on. You can provide the table's URL or [table ID](https://support.airtable.com/docs/finding-airtable-ids#finding-base-table-and-view-ids-from-urls).

### Trigger Field

A created or last modified field in your table. The Airtable Trigger node uses this to determine what updates occurred since the previous check.

### Download Attachments

Whether to download attachments from the table. When enabled, the **Download Fields** parameter defines the attachment fields.

### Download Fields

When you enable the **Download Attachments** toggle, this field defines which table fields to download. Field names are case sensitive. Use a comma to separate multiple field names.

### Additional Fields

Use the **Add Field** button to add the following parameters:

* **Fields**: A comma-separated list of fields to include in the output. If you don't specify anything here, the output will contain only the **Trigger Field**.
* **Formula**: An [Airtable formula](https://support.airtable.com/docs/formula-field-reference) to further filter the results. You can use this to add further constraints to the events that trigger the workflow. Note that formula values aren't taken into account for manual executions, only for production polling.
* **View ID**: The name or ID of a table view. When defined, only returns records available in the given view.

## Common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the Facebook Lead Ads Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Workflow only works in testing or production

Facebook Lead Ads only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), Facebook Lead Ads overwrites the registered webhook URL. 

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. Facebook Lead Ads will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:

/// warning | Halts production traffic
This workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.
///

1. Go to your workflow page.
2. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
3. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
4. When you finish testing, toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.

# Facebook Trigger WhatsApp Business Account object

Use this object to receive updates when your WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) changes. Refer to [Facebook Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebooktrigger/index.md) for more information on the trigger itself.

/// warning | Use WhatsApp trigger
n8n recommends using the [WhatsApp Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.whatsapptrigger.md) with the [WhatsApp credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/whatsapp.md) instead of the Facebook Trigger node. That trigger node includes twice the events to subscribe to.
///

/// note | Credentials
You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookapp.md).
///

///  note  | Examples and templates
For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Facebook Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/facebook-trigger/){:target=_blank .external-link} page.
///

## Prerequisites

This Object requires some configuration in your app and WhatsApp account before you can use the trigger:

1. Subscribe your app under your WhatsApp business account. You must subscribe an app owned by your business. Apps shared with your business can't receive webhook notifications.
1. If you are working as a Solution Partner, make sure your app has completed App Review and requested the `whatsapp_business_management` permission.

## Trigger configuration

To configure the trigger with this Object:

1. Select the **Credential to connect with**. Select an existing or create a new [Facebook App credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookapp.md).
1. Enter the **APP ID** of the app connected to your credential. Refer to the [Facebook App credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookapp.md) documentation for more information.
1. Select **WhatsApp Business Account** as the **Object**.
1. **Field Names or IDs**: By default, the node will trigger on all the available events using the `*` wildcard filter. If you'd like to limit the events, use the `X` to remove the star and use the dropdown or an expression to select the updates you're interested in. Options include:
    * **Message Template Status Update**
    * **Phone Number Name Update**
    * **Phone Number Quality Update**
    * **Account Review Update**
    * **Account Update**
1. In **Options**, turn on the toggle to **Include Values**. This Object type fails without the option enabled.

# Google Drive Trigger node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Google Drive Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googledrivetrigger/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.


## 401 unauthorized error

The full text of the error looks like this:
<!--vale off-->
```
401 - {"error":"unauthorized_client","error_description":"Client is unauthorized to retrieve access tokens using this method, or client not authorized for any of the scopes requested."}
```
<!--vale on-->

This error occurs when there's an issue with the credential you're using and its scopes or permissions.

To resolve:

1. For [OAuth2](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/oauth-single-service.md) credentials, make sure you've enabled the Google Drive API in **APIs & Services > Library**. Refer to [Google OAuth2 Single Service - Enable APIs](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/oauth-single-service.md#enable-apis) for more information.
2. For [Service Account](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/service-account.md) credentials:

    2. Make sure you add the Google Drive API as part of the domain-wide delegation configuration.

## Handling more than one file change

The Google Drive Trigger node polls Google Drive for changes at a set interval (once every minute by default).

If multiple changes to the **Watch For** criteria occur during the polling interval, a single Google Drive Trigger event occurs containing the changes as items. To handle this, your workflow must account for times when the data might contain more than one item.

You can use an [if node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if.md) or a [switch node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch.md) to change your workflow's behavior depending on whether the data from the Google Drive Trigger node contains a single item or multiple items.

# Google Sheets Trigger node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Google Sheets Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheetstrigger/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Stuck waiting for trigger event

When testing the Google Sheets Trigger node with the **Execute step** or **Execute workflow** buttons, the execution may appear stuck and unable to stop listening for events. If this occurs, you may need to exit the workflow and open it again to reset the canvas.

Stuck listening events often occur due to issues with your network configuration outside of n8n. Specifically, this behavior often occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy without configuring websocket proxying.

To resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support.

## Date and time columns are rendering as numbers

Google Sheets can render dates and times a few different ways.

The [**serial number** format](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/DateTimeRenderOption), popularized by Lotus 1-2-3 and used my types of spreadsheet software, represents dates as a decimal number. The whole number component (the part left of the decimal) represents the number of days since December 30, 1899. The decimal portion (the part right of the decimal) represents time as a portion of a 24-hour period (for example, `.5` represents noon).

To use a different format for date and time values, adjust the format in your Google Sheet Trigger node. This is available when **Trigger On** is set to **Row Added**:

1. Open the Google Sheet Trigger node on your canvas.
2. Select **Add option**.
3. Select **DateTime Render**.
4. Change **DateTime Render** to **Formatted String**.

The Google Sheets Trigger node will now format date, time, datetime, and duration fields as strings according to their number format.

The number format depends on the spreadsheet's locale settings. You can change the local by opening the spreadsheet and selecting **File > Settings**. In the **General** tab, set **Locale** to your preferred locale. Select **Save settings** to adjust the value.

## Required scopes

To use this node, you need to create an application in Slack and enable event subscriptions. Refer to [Slack credentials | Slack Trigger configuration](/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack.md#slack-trigger-configuration) for more information.

You must add the appropriate scopes to your Slack app for this trigger node to work.

The node requires scopes for the [conversations.list](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list){:target=blank .external-link} and [users.list](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.list){:target=blank .external-link} methods at minimum. Check out the [Scopes | Slack credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack.md#scopes) list for a more complete list of scopes.

## Common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the Slack Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Workflow only works in testing or production

Slack only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that you can't switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa) without reconfiguring the registered webhook URL. 

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. Slack will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:

/// warning | Halts production traffic
This temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.
///

1. Go to your workflow page.
2. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
3. Edit the **Request URL** in your the [Slack Trigger configuration](/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack.md#slack-trigger-configuration) to use the testing webhook URL instead of the production webhook URL.
4. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
5. When you finish testing, edit the **Request URL** in your the [Slack Trigger configuration](/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack.md#slack-trigger-configuration) to use the production webhook URL instead of the testing webhook URL.
6. Toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.

# Telegram Trigger node common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Telegram Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegramtrigger/index.md) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Stuck waiting for trigger event

When testing the Telegram Trigger node with the **Execute step** or **Execute workflow** buttons, the execution may appear stuck and unable to stop listening for events. If this occurs, you may need to exit the workflow and open it again to reset the canvas.

Stuck listening events often occur due to issues with your network configuration outside of n8n. Specifically, this behavior often occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy without configuring websocket proxying.

To resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support.

<!-- vale off -->
## Bad request: bad webhook: An HTTPS URL must be provided for webhook
<!-- vale on -->

This error occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy and there is a problem with your instance's webhook URL.

When running n8n behind a reverse proxy, you must [configure the `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url.md) with the public URL where your n8n instance is running. For Telegram, this URL must use HTTPS.

To fix this issue, configure TLS/SSL termination in your reverse proxy. Afterward, update your `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable to use the HTTPS address.

## Workflow only works in testing or production

Telegram only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), Telegram overwrites the registered webhook URL. 

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. The Telegram bot will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can either disable your workflow when testing or create separate Telegram bots for testing and production.

To create a separate telegram bot for testing, repeat the process you completed to create your first bot. Reference [Telegram's bot documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots) and the [Telegram bot API reference](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) for more information.

To disable your workflow when testing, try the following:

/// warning | Halts production traffic
This workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.
///

1. Go to your workflow page.
2. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.

## Configure a webhook in TheHive

To configure the webhook for your TheHive instance:

1. Copy the testing and production webhook URLs from TheHive Trigger node.
2. Add the following lines to the `application.conf` file. This is TheHive configuration file:

	```
	notification.webhook.endpoints = [
		{
			name: TESTING_WEBHOOK_NAME
			url: TESTING_WEBHOOK_URL
			version: 0
			wsConfig: {}
			includedTheHiveOrganisations: ["ORGANIZATION_NAME"]
			excludedTheHiveOrganisations: []
		},
		{
			name: PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_NAME
			url: PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL
			version: 0
			wsConfig: {}
			includedTheHiveOrganisations: ["ORGANIZATION_NAME"]
			excludedTheHiveOrganisations: []
		}
	]
	```

3. Replace `TESTING_WEBHOOK_URL` and `PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL` with the URLs you copied in the previous step.
4. Replace `TESTING_WEBHOOK_NAME` and `PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_NAME` with your preferred endpoint names.
5. Replace `ORGANIZATION_NAME` with your organization name.
6. Execute the following cURL command to enable notifications:
	```sh
	curl -XPUT -uTHEHIVE_USERNAME:THEHIVE_PASSWORD -H 'Content-type: application/json' THEHIVE_URL/api/config/organisation/notification -d '
	{
		"value": [
			{
			"delegate": false,
			"trigger": { "name": "AnyEvent"},
			"notifier": { "name": "webhook", "endpoint": "TESTING_WEBHOOK_NAME" }
			},
			{
			"delegate": false,
			"trigger": { "name": "AnyEvent"},

## Find the Model ID

The model ID is the ID of any model in Trello. Depending on the use-case, it could be the User ID, List ID, and so on.

For this specific example, the List ID would be the Model ID:

1. Open the Trello board that contains the list.
2. If the list doesn't have any cards, add a card to the list.
3. Open the card, add `.json` at the end of the URL, and press enter.
4. In the JSON file, you will see a field called `idList`.
5. Copy `idList`and paste it in the **Model ID** field in n8n.

## Common issues

Here are some common errors and issues with the WhatsApp Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Workflow only works in testing or production

WhatsApp only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), WhatsApp overwrites the registered webhook URL. 

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. WhatsApp will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:

/// warning | Halts production traffic
This workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.
///

1. Go to your workflow page.
2. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
3. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
4. When you finish testing, toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.

# n8n community node blocklist

n8n maintains a blocklist of community nodes. You can't install any node on this list.

n8n may add community nodes to the blocklist for a range of reasons, including:

* The node is intentionally malicious
* It's low quality (low enough to be harmful)

<!-- vale off -->

If you are a community node creator whose node is on the blocklist, and you believe this is a mistake, contact [hello@n8n.io](mailto: hello@n8n.io).

# Install community nodes from npm in the n8n app

/// note | Only for instance owners of self-hosted n8n instances
Only the n8n instance owner of a self-hosted n8n instance can install and manage community nodes from npm. The instance owner is the person who sets up and manages user management.

Admin accounts can also uninstall any community node, verified or unverified. This helps them remove problematic nodes that may affect the instance's health and functionality.
///

## Install a community node

To install a community node from npm:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Community Nodes**.
2. Select **Install**.
3. Find the node you want to install:
    1. Select **Browse**. n8n takes you to an npm search results page, showing all npm packages tagged with the keyword `n8n-community-node-package`.
    2. Browse the list of results. You can filter the results or add more keywords.
    3. Once you find the package you want, make a note of the package name. If you want to install a specific version, make a note of the version number as well.
    4. Return to n8n.
4. Enter the npm package name, and version number if required. For example, consider a community node designed to access a weather API called "Storms." The package name is n8n-node-storms, and it has three major versions.
    * To install the latest version of a package called n8n-node-weather: enter `n8n-nodes-storms` in **Enter npm package name**.
    * To install version 2.3: enter `n8n-node-storms@2.3` in **Enter npm package name**.
    <!-- vale off -->
5. Agree to the [risks](/integrations/community-nodes/risks.md) of using community nodes: select **I understand the risks of installing unverified code from a public source.**
    <!-- vale on -->
6. Select **Install**. n8n installs the node, and returns to the **Community Nodes** list in **Settings**.

/// note | Nodes on the blocklist
n8n maintains a blocklist of community nodes that it prevents you from installing. Refer to [n8n community node blocklist](/integrations/community-nodes/blocklist.md) for more information.
///
## Uninstall a community node

To uninstall a community node:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Community nodes**.
2. On the node you want to install, select **Options** <span class="inline-image">![Three dots options menu](/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png){.off-glb}</span>.
3. Select **Uninstall package**.
4. Select **Uninstall Package** in the confirmation modal.

## Upgrade a community node

/// warning | Breaking changes in versions
Node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes. If you find that an upgrade causes issues, you can [downgrade](#downgrade-a-community-node).
///
### Upgrade to the latest version

You can upgrade community nodes to the latest version from the node list in **Settings** > **community nodes**.

When a new version of a community node is available, n8n displays an **Update** button on the node. Click the button to upgrade to the latest version.

### Upgrade to a specific version

To upgrade to a specific version (a version other than the latest), uninstall the node, then reinstall it, making sure to specify the target version. Follow the [Installation](#install-a-community-node) instructions for more guidance.

## Downgrade a community node

If there is a problem with a particular version of a community node, you may want to roll back to a previous version.

To do this, uninstall the community node, then reinstall it, targeting a specific node version. Follow the [Installation](#install-a-community-node) instructions for more guidance.

# Install and manage community nodes

There are three ways to install community nodes:

* Within n8n using the [nodes panel](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/verified-install.md) (for verified community nodes only).
* Within n8n [using the GUI](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/gui-install.md): Use this method to install community nodes from the npm registry.
* [Manually from the command line](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/manual-install.md): use this method to install community nodes from npm if your n8n instance doesn't support installation through the in-app GUI.

/// note | Installing from npm only available on self-hosted instances
Unverified community nodes aren't available on n8n cloud and require [self-hosting](/hosting/index.md) n8n.
///

# Manually install community nodes from npm

You can manually install community nodes from the npm registry on self-hosted n8n.

You need to manually install community nodes in the following circumstances:

* Your n8n instance runs in queue mode.
* You want to install [private packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-private-packages){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Install a community node

Access your Docker shell:

```sh
docker exec -it n8n sh
```

Create `~/.n8n/nodes` if it doesn't already exist, and navigate into it:

```sh
mkdir ~/.n8n/nodes
cd ~/.n8n/nodes
```

Install the node:

```sh
npm i n8n-nodes-nodeName
```
Then restart n8n.

## Uninstall a community node

Access your Docker shell:

```sh
docker exec -it n8n sh
```

Run npm uninstall:

```sh
npm uninstall n8n-nodes-nodeName
```

## Upgrade a community node

/// warning | Breaking changes in versions

# Install verified community nodes in the n8n app

/// note | Limited to n8n instance owners
Only the n8n instance owner can install and manage verified community nodes. The instance owner is the person who sets up and manages user management. All members of an n8n instance can use already installed community nodes in their workflows.

Admin accounts can also uninstall any community node, verified or unverified. This helps them remove problematic nodes that may affect the instance's health and functionality.
///

## Install a community node

To install a [verified community node](/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/submit-community-nodes.md#submit-your-node-for-verification-by-n8n):

1. Go to the **Canvas** and open the **nodes panel** (either by selecting '+' or pressing ++tab++).
2. **Search** for the node that you're looking for. If there is a matching verified community node, you will see a **More from the community** section at the bottom of the nodes panel.
3. Select the node you want to install. This takes you to a detailed view of the node, showing all the supported actions.
4. Select **install**. This will install the node for your instance and enable all members to use it in their workflows.
5. You can now add the node to your workflows.

/// note | Enable installation of verified community nodes
Some users may not want to show verified community nodes in the nodes panel of their instances. On n8n cloud, instance owners can toggle this in the [Cloud Admin Panel](/manage-cloud/cloud-admin-dashboard.md). Self-hosted users can use [environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes.md) to control the availability of this feature.

# Risks when using community nodes

Installing community nodes from npm means you are installing unverified code from a public source into your n8n instance. This has some risks.

Risks include:

* System security: community nodes have full access to the machine that n8n runs on, and can do anything, including malicious actions.
* Data security: any community node that you use has access to data in your workflows.
* Breaking changes: node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes.

/// note | n8n vets verified community nodes
In addition to publicly available community nodes from npm, n8n inspects some nodes and makes them available as [verified community node inside the nodes panel](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/verified-install.md). These nodes have to meet a set of data and system security requirements for approval.
///

## Report bad community nodes

<!-- vale off -->

You can report bad community nodes to [security@n8n.io](mailto: security@n8n.io)

<!-- vale on -->

## Disable community nodes

If you are self-hosting n8n, you can disable community nodes by setting `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ENABLED` to `false`. On n8n cloud, visit the [Cloud Admin Panel](https://docs.n8n.io/manage-cloud/cloud-admin-dashboard/) and disable community nodes from there. See [troubleshooting](/integrations/community-nodes/troubleshooting.md) for more information.

# Troubleshooting and errors

## Error: Missing packages

n8n installs community nodes directly onto the hard disk. The files must be available at startup for n8n to load them. If the packages aren't available at startup, you get an error warning of missing packages.

If running n8n using Docker: depending on your Docker setup, you may lose the packages when you recreate your container or upgrade your n8n version. You must either:

* Persist the contents of the `~/.n8n/nodes` directory. This is the best option. If you follow the [Docker installation](/hosting/installation/docker.md) guide, the setup steps include persisting this directory.
* Set the `N8N_REINSTALL_MISSING_PACKAGES` environment variable to `true`.

The second option might increase startup time and may cause health checks to fail.

## Prevent loading community nodes on n8n cloud

If your n8n cloud instance crashes and fails to start, you can prevent installed community nodes from loading on instance startup. Visit the [Cloud Admin Panel](/manage-cloud/cloud-admin-dashboard.md) > **Manage** and toggle **Disable all community nodes** to **`true`**. This toggle is only visible when you allow community node installation.

# Using community nodes

To use community nodes, you first need to [install](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/index.md) them.

## Adding community nodes to your workflow

After installing a community node, you can use it like any other node. n8n displays the node in search results in the **Nodes** panel. n8n marks community nodes with a **Package** <span class="inline-image">![Package icon](/_images/common-icons/package.png){.off-glb}</span> icon in the nodes panel.

## Community nodes with duplicate names

It's possible for several community nodes to have the same name. If you use two nodes with the same name in your workflow, they'll look the same, unless they have different icons.

# Build a declarative-style node

This tutorial walks through building a declarative-style node. Before you begin, make sure this is the node style you need. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method.md) for more information.

## Prerequisites

You need the following installed on your development machine:

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/prerequisites.md"

You need some understanding of:

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- REST APIs
- git

## Build your node

In this section, you'll clone n8n's node starter repository, and build a node that integrates the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/){:target=_blank .external-link}. You'll create a node that uses two of NASA's services: APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) and Mars Rover Photos. To keep the code examples short, the node won't implement every available option for the Mars Rover Photos endpoint.

/// note | Existing node
n8n has a built-in NASA node. To avoid clashing with the existing node, you'll give your version a different name.
///
### Step 1: Set up the project


n8n provides a starter repository for node development. Using the starter ensures you have all necessary dependencies. It also provides a linter. 

Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:

1. [Generate a new repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/generate) from the template repository.
2. Clone your new repository:
		```shell
		git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo-name>.git n8n-nodes-nasa-pics
		cd n8n-nodes-nasa-pics
		```

The starter contains example nodes and credentials. Delete the following directories and files:

* `nodes/ExampleNode`
* `nodes/HTTPBin`
* `credentials/ExampleCredentials.credentials.ts`
* `credentials/HttpBinApi.credentials.ts`

Now create the following directories and files:

`nodes/NasaPics`  
`nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.json`  
`nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.ts`  
`credentials/NasaPicsApi.credentials.ts`  

These are the key files required for any node. Refer to [Node file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure.md) for more information on required files and recommended organization.

Now install the project dependencies:

```shell
npm i
```

### Step 2: Add an icon

Save the NASA SVG logo from [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/NASA_logo.svg){:target=_blank .external-link} as `nasapics.svg` in `nodes/NasaPics/`.


--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/node-icons.md"


### Step 3: Create the node

Every node must have a base file. Refer to [Node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/index.md) for detailed information about base file parameters.

In this example, the file is `NasaPics.node.ts`. To keep this tutorial short, you'll place all the node functionality in this one file. When building more complex nodes, you should consider splitting out your functionality into modules. Refer to [Node file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure.md) for more information.

#### Step 3.1: Imports

Start by adding the import statements:

```typescript
import { INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow';
```

#### Step 3.2: Create the main class

The node must export an interface that implements INodeType. This interface must include a `description` interface, which in turn contains the `properties` array.

/// note | Class names and file names
Make sure the class name and the file name match. For example, given a class `NasaPics`, the filename must be `NasaPics.node.ts`.
///
```typescript
export class NasaPics implements INodeType {
	description: INodeTypeDescription = {
		// Basic node details will go here
		properties: [
		// Resources and operations will go here
		]
	};
}
```

#### Step 3.3: Add node details

All nodes need some basic parameters, such as their display name, icon, and the basic information for making a request using the node. Add the following to the `description`:

```typescript
displayName: 'NASA Pics',
name: 'NasaPics',
icon: 'file:nasapics.svg',
group: ['transform'],
version: 1,
subtitle: '={{$parameter["operation"] + ": " + $parameter["resource"]}}',
description: 'Get data from NASAs API',
defaults: {
	name: 'NASA Pics',
},
inputs: ['main'],
outputs: ['main'],
credentials: [
	{
		name: 'NasaPicsApi',
		required: true,
	},
],
requestDefaults: {
	baseURL: 'https://api.nasa.gov',
	headers: {
		Accept: 'application/json',
		'Content-Type': 'application/json',
	},
},
```

n8n uses some of the properties set in `description` to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are `displayName`, `icon`, `description`, and `subtitle`.

#### Step 3.4: Add resources

The resource object defines the API resource that the node uses. In this tutorial, you're creating a node to access two of NASA's API endpoints: `planetary/apod` and `mars-photos`. This means you need to define two resource options in `NasaPics.node.ts`. Update the `properties` array with the resource object:

```typescript
properties: [
	{
		displayName: 'Resource',
		name: 'resource',
		type: 'options',
		noDataExpression: true,
		options: [
			{
				name: 'Astronomy Picture of the Day',
				value: 'astronomyPictureOfTheDay',
			},
			{
				name: 'Mars Rover Photos',
				value: 'marsRoverPhotos',
			},
		],
		default: 'astronomyPictureOfTheDay',
	},
	// Operations will go here

]
```

`type` controls which UI element n8n displays for the resource, and tells n8n what type of data to expect from the user. `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements.md) for more information.

#### Step 3.5: Add operations

The operations object defines the available operations on a resource.

In a declarative-style node, the operations object includes `routing` (within the `options` array). This sets up the details of the API call.

Add the following to the `properties` array, after the `resource` object:

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Operation',
	name: 'operation',
	type: 'options',
	noDataExpression: true,
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			resource: [
				'astronomyPictureOfTheDay',
			],
		},
	},
	options: [
		{
			name: 'Get',
			value: 'get',
			action: 'Get the APOD',
			description: 'Get the Astronomy Picture of the day',
			routing: {
				request: {
					method: 'GET',
					url: '/planetary/apod',
				},
			},
		},
	],
	default: 'get',
},
{
	displayName: 'Operation',
	name: 'operation',
	type: 'options',
	noDataExpression: true,
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			resource: [
				'marsRoverPhotos',
			],
		},
	},
	options: [
		{
			name: 'Get',
			value: 'get',
			action: 'Get Mars Rover photos',
			description: 'Get photos from the Mars Rover',
			routing: {
				request: {
					method: 'GET',
				},
			},
		},
	],
	default: 'get',
},
{
	displayName: 'Rover name',
	description: 'Choose which Mars Rover to get a photo from',
	required: true,
	name: 'roverName',
	type: 'options',
	options: [
		{name: 'Curiosity', value: 'curiosity'},
		{name: 'Opportunity', value: 'opportunity'},
		{name: 'Perseverance', value: 'perseverance'},
		{name: 'Spirit', value: 'spirit'},
	],
	routing: {
		request: {
			url: '=/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/{{$value}}/photos',
		},
	},
	default: 'curiosity',
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			resource: [
				'marsRoverPhotos',
			],
		},
	},
},
{
	displayName: 'Date',
	description: 'Earth date',
	required: true,
	name: 'marsRoverDate',
	type: 'dateTime',
	default:'',
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			resource: [
				'marsRoverPhotos',
			],
		},
	},
	routing: {
		request: {
			// You've already set up the URL. qs appends the value of the field as a query string
			qs: {
				earth_date: '={{ new Date($value).toISOString().substr(0,10) }}',
			},
		},
	},
},
// Optional/additional fields will go here
```

This code creates two operations: one to get today's APOD image, and another to send a get request for photos from one of the Mars Rovers. The object named `roverName` requires the user to choose which Rover they want photos from. The `routing` object in the Mars Rover operation references this to create the URL for the API call.

#### Step 3.6: Optional fields

Most APIs, including the NASA API that you're using in this example, have optional fields you can use to refine your query.

To avoid overwhelming users, n8n displays these under **Additional Fields** in the UI.

For this tutorial, you'll add one additional field, to allow users to pick a date to use with the APOD endpoint. Add the following to the properties array:

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Additional Fields',
	name: 'additionalFields',
	type: 'collection',
	default: {},
	placeholder: 'Add Field',
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			resource: [
				'astronomyPictureOfTheDay',
			],
			operation: [
				'get',
			],
		},
	},
	options: [
		{
			displayName: 'Date',
			name: 'apodDate',
			type: 'dateTime',
			default: '',
			routing: {
				request: {
					// You've already set up the URL. qs appends the value of the field as a query string
					qs: {
						date: '={{ new Date($value).toISOString().substr(0,10) }}',
					},
				},
			},
		},
	],									
}
```


### Step 4: Set up authentication

The NASA API requires users to authenticate with an API key.

Add the following to `nasaPicsApi.credentials.ts`:

```typescript
import {
	IAuthenticateGeneric,
	ICredentialType,
	INodeProperties,
} from 'n8n-workflow';

export class NasaPicsApi implements ICredentialType {
	name = 'NasaPicsApi';
	displayName = 'NASA Pics API';
	// Uses the link to this tutorial as an example
	// Replace with your own docs links when building your own nodes
	documentationUrl = 'https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/';
	properties: INodeProperties[] = [
		{
			displayName: 'API Key',
			name: 'apiKey',
			type: 'string',
			default: '',
		},
	];
	authenticate = {
		type: 'generic',
		properties: {
			qs: {
				'api_key': '={{$credentials.apiKey}}'
			}
		},
	} as IAuthenticateGeneric;
}
```

For more information about credentials files and options, refer to [Credentials file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/credentials-files.md).


### Step 5: Add node metadata

Metadata about your node goes in the JSON file at the root of your node. n8n refers to this as the codex file. In this example, the file is `NasaPics.node.json`.

Add the following code to the JSON file:

```json
{
	"node": "n8n-nodes-base.NasaPics",
	"nodeVersion": "1.0",
	"codexVersion": "1.0",
	"categories": [
		"Miscellaneous"
	],
	"resources": {
		"credentialDocumentation": [
			{
				"url": ""
			}
		],
		"primaryDocumentation": [
			{
				"url": ""
			}
		]
	}
}
```

For more information on these parameters, refer to [Node codex files](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-codex-files.md).

### Step 6: Update the npm package details

Your npm package details are in the `package.json` at the root of the project. It's essential to include the `n8n` object with links to the credentials and base node file. Update this file to include the following information:

```json
{
	// All node names must start with "n8n-nodes-"
	"name": "n8n-nodes-nasapics",
	"version": "0.1.0",
	"description": "n8n node to call NASA's APOD and Mars Rover Photo services.",
	"keywords": [
		// This keyword is required for community nodes
		"n8n-community-node-package"
	],
	"license": "MIT",
	"homepage": "https://n8n.io",
	"author": {
		"name": "Test",
		"email": "test@example.com"

# Set up your development environment

This document lists the essential dependencies for developing a node, as well as guidance on setting up your editor.

## Requirements

To build and test a node, you need: 

* Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm){:target=_blank class=.external-link}. For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows){:target=_blank class=.external-link}.
* A local instance of n8n. You can install n8n with `npm install n8n -g`, then follow the steps in [Run your node locally](/integrations/creating-nodes/test/run-node-locally.md) to test your node.

You should also have [git](https://git-scm.com/){:target=_blank class=.external-link} installed. This allows you to clone and use the [n8n-node-starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter){:target=_blank class=.external-link}.

## Editor setup

n8n recommends using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target=_blank class=.external-link} as your editor.

Install these extensions:

* [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint){:target=_blank class=.external-link}
* [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig){:target=_blank class=.external-link}
* [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode){:target=_blank class=.external-link}

By using VS Code and these extensions, you get access to the n8n node linter's warnings as you code.

# Build a programmatic-style node

This tutorial walks through building a programmatic-style node. Before you begin, make sure this is the node style you need. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method.md) for more information.

## Prerequisites

You need the following installed on your development machine:

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/prerequisites.md"

You need some understanding of:

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- REST APIs
- git
- [Expressions](/glossary.md#expression-n8n) in n8n


## Build your node

In this section, you'll clone n8n's node starter repository, and build a node that integrates the [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/){:target=_blank .external-link}. You'll create a node that implements one piece of SendGrid functionality: create a contact.

/// note | Existing node
n8n has a built-in SendGrid node. To avoid clashing with the existing node, you'll give your version a different name.
///
### Step 1: Set up the project

n8n provides a starter repository for node development. Using the starter ensures you have all necessary dependencies. It also provides a linter. 

Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:

1. [Generate a new repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/generate){:target=_blank .external-link} from the template repository.
2. Clone your new repository:
		```shell
		git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo-name>.git n8n-nodes-friendgrid
		cd n8n-nodes-friendgrid
		```

The starter contains example nodes and credentials. Delete the following directories and files:

* `nodes/ExampleNode`
* `nodes/HTTPBin`
* `credentials/ExampleCredentials.credentials.ts`
* `credentials/HttpBinApi.credentials.ts`

Now create the following directories and files:

`nodes/FriendGrid`  
`nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.json`  
`nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.ts`  
`credentials/FriendGridApi.credentials.ts`  

These are the key files required for any node. Refer to [Node file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure.md) for more information on required files and recommended organization.

Now install the project dependencies:

```shell
npm i
```

### Step 2: Add an icon

Save the SendGrid SVG logo from [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/SendGrid/sendGrid.svg){:target=_blank .external-link} as `friendGrid.svg` in `nodes/FriendGrid/`.


--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/node-icons.md"


### Step 3: Define the node in the base file

Every node must have a base file. Refer to [Node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/index.md) for detailed information about base file parameters.

In this example, the file is `FriendGrid.node.ts`. To keep this tutorial short, you'll place all the node functionality in this one file. When building more complex nodes, you should consider splitting out your functionality into modules. Refer to [Node file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure.md) for more information.

#### Step 3.1: Imports

Start by adding the import statements:

```typescript
import {
	IExecuteFunctions,
} from 'n8n-core';

import {
	IDataObject,
	INodeExecutionData,
	INodeType,
	INodeTypeDescription,
} from 'n8n-workflow';

import {
	OptionsWithUri,
} from 'request';
```

#### Step 3.2: Create the main class

The node must export an interface that implements `INodeType`. This interface must include a `description` interface, which in turn contains the `properties` array.

/// note | Class names and file names
Make sure the class name and the file name match. For example, given a class `FriendGrid`, the filename must be `FriendGrid.node.ts`.
///
```typescript
export class FriendGrid implements INodeType {
	description: INodeTypeDescription = {
		// Basic node details will go here
		properties: [
			// Resources and operations will go here
		],
	};
	// The execute method will go here
	async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> {
	}
}
```

#### Step 3.3: Add node details

All programmatic nodes need some basic parameters, such as their display name and icon. Add the following to the `description`:

```typescript
displayName: 'FriendGrid',
name: 'friendGrid',
icon: 'file:friendGrid.svg',
group: ['transform'],
version: 1,
description: 'Consume SendGrid API',
defaults: {
	name: 'FriendGrid',
},
inputs: ['main'],
outputs: ['main'],
credentials: [
	{
		name: 'friendGridApi',
		required: true,
	},
],
```

n8n uses some of the properties set in `description` to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are `displayName`, `icon`, and `description`.

#### Step 3.4: Add the resource

The resource object defines the API resource that the node uses. In this tutorial, you're creating a node to access one of SendGrid's API endpoints: `/v3/marketing/contacts`. This means you need to define a resource for this endpoint. Update the `properties` array with the resource object:

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Resource',
	name: 'resource',
	type: 'options',
	options: [
		{
			name: 'Contact',
			value: 'contact',
		},
	],
	default: 'contact',
	noDataExpression: true,
	required: true,
	description: 'Create a new contact',
},
```

`type` controls which UI element n8n displays for the resource, and tells n8n what type of data to expect from the user. `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements.md) for more information.

#### Step 3.5: Add operations

The operations object defines what you can do with a resource. It usually relates to REST API verbs (GET, POST, and so on). In this tutorial, there's one operation: create a contact. It has one required field, the email address for the contact the user creates.

Add the following to the `properties` array, after the `resource` object:

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Operation',
	name: 'operation',
	type: 'options',
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			resource: [
				'contact',
			],
		},
	},
	options: [
		{
			name: 'Create',
			value: 'create',
			description: 'Create a contact',
			action: 'Create a contact',
		},
	],
	default: 'create',
	noDataExpression: true,
},
{
	displayName: 'Email',
	name: 'email',
	type: 'string',
	required: true,
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			operation: [
				'create',
			],
			resource: [
				'contact',
			],
		},
	},
	default:'',
	placeholder: 'name@email.com',
	description:'Primary email for the contact',
},
```

#### Step 3.6: Add optional fields

Most APIs, including the SendGrid API that you're using in this example, have optional fields you can use to refine your query.

To avoid overwhelming users, n8n displays these under **Additional Fields** in the UI.

For this tutorial, you'll add two additional fields, to allow users to enter the contact's first name and last name. Add the following to the properties array:

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Additional Fields',
	name: 'additionalFields',
	type: 'collection',
	placeholder: 'Add Field',
	default: {},
	displayOptions: {
		show: {
			resource: [
				'contact',
			],
			operation: [
				'create',
			],
		},
	},
	options: [
		{
			displayName: 'First Name',
			name: 'firstName',
			type: 'string',
			default: '',
		},
		{
			displayName: 'Last Name',
			name: 'lastName',
			type: 'string',
			default: '',
		},
	],
},
```

### Step 4: Add the execute method

You've set up the node UI and basic information. It's time to map the node UI to API requests, and make the node actually do something.

The `execute` method runs every time the node runs. In this method, you have access to the input items and to the parameters that the user set in the UI, including the credentials.

Add the following the `execute` method in the `FriendGrid.node.ts`:

```typescript
// Handle data coming from previous nodes
const items = this.getInputData();
let responseData;
const returnData = [];
const resource = this.getNodeParameter('resource', 0) as string;
const operation = this.getNodeParameter('operation', 0) as string;

// For each item, make an API call to create a contact
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
	if (resource === 'contact') {
		if (operation === 'create') {
			// Get email input
			const email = this.getNodeParameter('email', i) as string;
			// Get additional fields input
			const additionalFields = this.getNodeParameter('additionalFields', i) as IDataObject;
			const data: IDataObject = {
				email,
			};

			Object.assign(data, additionalFields);

			// Make HTTP request according to https://sendgrid.com/docs/api-reference/
			const options: OptionsWithUri = {
				headers: {
					'Accept': 'application/json',
				},
				method: 'PUT',
				body: {
					contacts: [
						data,
					],
				},
				uri: `https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing/contacts`,
				json: true,
			};
			responseData = await this.helpers.requestWithAuthentication.call(this, 'friendGridApi', options);
			returnData.push(responseData);
		}
	}
}
// Map data to n8n data structure
return [this.helpers.returnJsonArray(returnData)];
```

Note the following lines of this code:

```typescript
const items = this.getInputData();
... 
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
	...
	const email = this.getNodeParameter('email', i) as string;
	...
}
```

Users can provide data in two ways:

* Entered directly in the node fields
* By mapping data from earlier nodes in the workflow

`getInputData()`, and the subsequent loop, allows the node to handle situations where data comes from a previous node. This includes supporting multiple inputs. This means that if, for example, the previous node outputs contact information for five people, your FriendGrid node can create five contacts.


### Step 5: Set up authentication

The SendGrid API requires users to authenticate with an API key.

Add the following to `FriendGridApi.credentials.ts`

```typescript
import {
	IAuthenticateGeneric,
	ICredentialTestRequest,
	ICredentialType,
	INodeProperties,
} from 'n8n-workflow';

export class FriendGridApi implements ICredentialType {
	name = 'friendGridApi';
	displayName = 'FriendGrid API';
	properties: INodeProperties[] = [
		{
			displayName: 'API Key',
			name: 'apiKey',
			type: 'string',
			default: '',
		},
	];

	authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {
		type: 'generic',
		properties: {
			headers: {
				Authorization: '=Bearer {{$credentials.apiKey}}',
			},
		},
	};

	test: ICredentialTestRequest = {
		request: {
			baseURL: 'https://api.sendgrid.com/v3',
			url: '/marketing/contacts',
		},
	};
}

```

For more information about credentials files and options, refer to [Credentials file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/credentials-files.md).

### Step 6: Add node metadata

Metadata about your node goes in the JSON file at the root of your node. n8n refers to this as the codex file. In this example, the file is `FriendGrid.node.json`.

Add the following code to the JSON file:

```json
{
	"node": "n8n-nodes-base.FriendGrid",
	"nodeVersion": "1.0",
	"codexVersion": "1.0",
	"categories": [
		"Miscellaneous"
	],
	"resources": {
		"credentialDocumentation": [
			{
				"url": ""
			}
		],
		"primaryDocumentation": [
			{
				"url": ""
			}
		]
	}
}
```

For more information on these parameters, refer to [Node codex files](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-codex-files.md).


### Step 7: Update the npm package details

Your npm package details are in the `package.json` at the root of the project. It's essential to include the `n8n` object with links to the credentials and base node file. Update this file to include the following information:

```json
{
	// All node names must start with "n8n-nodes-"
	"name": "n8n-nodes-friendgrid",
	"version": "0.1.0",
	"description": "n8n node to create contacts in SendGrid",
	"keywords": [
		// This keyword is required for community nodes
		"n8n-community-node-package"
	],
	"license": "MIT",
	"homepage": "https://n8n.io",
	"author": {
		"name": "Test",
		"email": "test@example.com"
	},
	"repository": {
		"type": "git",
		// Change the git remote to your own repository
		// Add the new URL here
		"url": "git+<your-repo-url>"
	},
	"main": "index.js",
	"scripts": {
		// don't change
	},
	"files": [
		"dist"
	],
	// Link the credentials and node
	"n8n": {
		"n8nNodesApiVersion": 1,
		"credentials": [
			"dist/credentials/FriendGridApi.credentials.js"
		],
		"nodes": [
			"dist/nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.js"
		]
	},
	"devDependencies": {
		// don't change
	},
	"peerDependencies": {
		// don't change
	}
}
```

You need to update the `package.json` to include your own information, such as your name and repository URL. For more information on npm `package.json` files, refer to [npm's package.json documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json){:target=_blank .external-link}.



## Test your node

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/testing.md"

## Next steps

* [Deploy your node](/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/index.md).
* View an example of a programmatic node: n8n's [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost){:target=_blank .external-link}. This is an example of a more complex programmatic node structure.
* Learn about [node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning.md).
* Make sure you understand key concepts: [item linking](/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts.md) and [data structures](/data/data-structure.md).

# Code standards

Following defined code standards when building your node makes your code more readable and maintainable, and helps avoid errors. This document provides guidance on good code practices for node building. It focuses on code details. For UI standards and UX guidance, refer to [Node UI design](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/node-ui-design.md).

## Use the linter

The n8n node linter provides automatic checking for many of the node-building standards. You should ensure your node passes the linter's checks before publishing it. Refer to the [n8n node linter](/integrations/creating-nodes/test/node-linter.md) documentation for more information.

## Use the starter

The n8n node starter project includes a recommended setup, dependencies (including the linter), and examples to help you get started. Begin new projects with the [starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Write in TypeScript

All n8n code is TypeScript. Writing your nodes in TypeScript can speed up development and reduce bugs.

## Detailed guidelines for writing a node

These guidelines apply to any node you build. 

### Resources and operations

If your node can perform several operations, call the parameter that sets the operation `Operation`. If your node can do these operations on more than one resource, create a `Resource` parameter. The following code sample shows a basic resource and operations setup:

```js
export const ExampleNode implements INodeType {
    description: {
        displayName: 'Example Node',
        ...
        properties: [
            {
                displayName: 'Resource',
                name: 'resource',
                type: 'options',
                options: [
                    {
                        name: 'Resource One',
                        value: 'resourceOne'
                    },
                    {
                        name: 'Resource Two',
                        value: 'resourceTwo'
                    }
                ],
                default: 'resourceOne'
            },
            {
                displayName: 'Operation',
                name: 'operation',
                type: 'options',
                // Only show these operations for Resource One
                displayOptions: {
                    show: {
                        resource: [
                            'resourceOne'
                        ]
                    }
                },
                options: [
                    {
                        name: 'Create',
                        value: 'create',
                        description: 'Create an instance of Resource One'
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Reuse internal parameter names

All resource and operation fields in an n8n node have two settings: a display name, set using the `name` parameter, and an internal name, set using the `value` parameter. Reusing the internal name for fields allows n8n to preserve user-entered data if a user switches operations. 

For example: you're building a node with a resource named 'Order'. This resource has several operations, including Get, Edit, and Delete. Each of these operations uses an order ID to perform the operation on the specified order. You need to display an ID field for the user. This field has a display label, and an internal name. By using the same internal name (set in `value`) for the operation ID field on each resource, a user can enter the ID with the Get operation selected, and not lose it if they switch to Edit.

When reusing the internal name, you must ensure that only one field is visible to the user at a time. You can control this using `displayOptions`.

## Detailed guidelines for writing a programmatic-style node

These guidelines apply when building nodes using the programmatic node-building style. They aren't relevant when using the declarative style. For more information on different node-building styles, refer to [Choose your node building approach](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method.md).

### Don't change incoming data

Never change the incoming data a node receives (data accessible with `this.getInputData()`) as all nodes share it. If you need to add, change, or delete data, clone the incoming data and return the new data. If you don't do this, sibling nodes that execute after the current one will operate on the altered data and process incorrect data.

It's not necessary to always clone all the data. For example, if a node changes the binary data but not the JSON data, you can create a new item that reuses the reference to the JSON item.


### Use the built in request library

Some third-party services have their own libraries on npm, which make it easier to create an integration. The problem with these packages is that you add another dependency (plus all the dependencies of the dependencies). This adds more and more code, which has to be loaded, can introduce security vulnerabilities, bugs, and so on. Instead, use the built-in module:

```typescript
// If no auth needed
const response = await this.helpers.httpRequest(options);

// If auth needed
const response = await this.helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication.call(
	this, 
	'credentialTypeName', // For example: pipedriveApi
	options,
);
```

This uses the npm package [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios){:target=_blank .external-link}.

Refer to [HTTP helpers](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/http-helpers.md) for more information, and for migration instructions for the removed `this.helpers.request`.

# Credentials file

The credentials file defines the authorization methods for the node. The settings in this file affect what n8n displays in the **Credentials** modal, and must reflect the authentication requirements of the service you're connecting to.

In the credentials file, you can use all the [n8n UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements.md). n8n encrypts the data that's stored using credentials using an encryption key.

## Structure of the credentials file

The credentials file follows this basic structure:

1. Import statements
2. Create a class for the credentials
3. Within the class, define the properties that control authentication for the node.

### Outline structure

```js
import {
	IAuthenticateGeneric,
	ICredentialTestRequest,
	ICredentialType,
	INodeProperties,
} from 'n8n-workflow';

export class ExampleNode implements ICredentialType {
	name = 'exampleNodeApi';
	displayName = 'Example Node API';
	documentationUrl = '';
	properties: INodeProperties[] = [
		{
			displayName: 'API Key',
			name: 'apiKey',
			type: 'string',
			default: '',
		},
	];
	authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {
		type: 'generic',
		properties: {
    		// Can be body, header, qs or auth
			qs: {
        		// Use the value from `apiKey` above
				'api_key': '={{$credentials.apiKey}}'
			}

		},
	};
	test: ICredentialTestRequest = {
		request: {
			baseURL: '={{$credentials?.domain}}',
			url: '/bearer',
		},
	};
}
```


## Parameters

### `name`

String. The internal name of the object. Used to reference it from other places in the node.

### `displayName`

String. The name n8n uses in the GUI.

### `documentationUrl`

String. URL to your credentials documentation.

### `properties`

Each object contains:

* `displayName`: the name n8n uses in the GUI.
* `name`: the internal name of the object. Used to reference it from other places in the node.
* `type`: the data type expected, such as `string`.
* `default`: the URL that n8n should use to test credentials.

### `authenticate`

* `authenticate`: Object. Contains objects that tell n8n how to inject the authentication data as part of the API request. 

#### `type`

String. If you're using an authentication method that sends data in the header, body, or query string, set this to `'generic'`. 

#### `properties`

Object. Defines the authentication methods. Options are:

* `body`: Object. Sends authentication data in the request body. Can contain nested objects.
```typescript
authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {
	type: 'generic',
	properties: {
		body: {
			username: '={{$credentials.username}}',
			password: '={{$credentials.password}}',
		},
	},
};
``` 

* `header`: Object. Send authentication data in the request header.
```typescript
authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {
	type: 'generic',
	properties: {
		header: {
			Authorization: '=Bearer {{$credentials.authToken}}',
		},
	},
};
``` 

* `qs`: Object. Stands for "query string." Send authentication data in the request query string.
```typescript
authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {
	type: 'generic',
	properties: {
		qs: {
			token: '={{$credentials.token}}',
		},
	},
};
``` 

* `auth`: Object. Used for Basic Auth. Requires `username` and `password` as the key names.
```typescript
authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {
	type: 'generic',
	properties: {
		auth: {
			username: '={{$credentials.username}}',
			password: '={{$credentials.password}}',
		},
	},
};
```

### `test`

Provide a `request` object containing a URL and authentication type that n8n can use to test the credential.

```typescript
test: ICredentialTestRequest = {
		request: {
			baseURL: '={{$credentials?.domain}}',
			url: '/bearer',
		},
	};
```

# HTTP request helper for node builders

n8n provides a flexible helper for making HTTP requests, which abstracts away most of the complexity.

/// note | Programmatic style only
The information in this document is for node building using the programmatic style. It doesn't apply to declarative style nodes.
///
## Usage

Call the helper inside the `execute` function. 

```typescript
// If no auth needed
const response = await this.helpers.httpRequest(options);

// If auth needed
const response = await this.helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication.call(
	this, 
	'credentialTypeName', // For example: pipedriveApi
	options,
);
```

`options` is an object:

```typescript
{
	url: string;
	headers?: object;
	method?: 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE' | 'HEAD';
	body?: FormData | Array | string | number | object | Buffer | URLSearchParams;
	qs?: object;
	arrayFormat?: 'indices' | 'brackets' | 'repeat' | 'comma';
	auth?: {
		username: string,
		password: string,
	};
	disableFollowRedirect?: boolean;
	encoding?: 'arraybuffer' | 'blob' | 'document' | 'json' | 'text' | 'stream';
	skipSslCertificateValidation?: boolean;
	returnFullResponse?: boolean;
	proxy?: {
		host: string;
		port: string | number;
		auth?: {
			username: string;
			password: string;
		},
		protocol?: string;
	};
	timeout?: number;
	json?: boolean;
}	
```

`url` is required. The other fields are optional. The default method is `GET`.

Some notes about the possible fields:

- `body`: you can use a regular JavaScript object for JSON payload, a buffer for file uploads, an instance of FormData for `multipart/form-data`, and `URLSearchParams` for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
- `headers`: a key-value pair.  
	* If `body` is an instance of `FormData` then n8n adds `content-type: multipart/form-data` automatically.  
	* If `body` is an instance of `URLSearchParams`, then n8n adds `content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.  
	* To override this behavior, set a `content-type` header.
- `arrayFormat`: if your query string contains an array of data, such as `const qs = {IDs: [15,17]}`, the value of `arrayFormat` defines how n8n formats it.  
	* `indices` (default):  `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a[0]=b&a[1]=c`  
	* `brackets`: `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a[]=b&a[]=c`  
	* `repeat`: `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a=b&a=c`  
	* `comma`: `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a=b,c`
- `auth`: Used for Basic auth. Provide `username` and `password`. n8n recommends omitting this, and using `helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication(...)` instead.
- `disableFollowRedirect`: By default, n8n follows redirects. You can set this to true to prevent this from happening.
- `skipSslCertificateValidation`: Used for calling HTTPS services without proper certificate
- `returnFullResponse`: Instead of returning just the body, returns an object with more data in the following format: `{body: body, headers: object, statusCode: 200, statusMessage: 'OK'}`
- `encoding`: n8n can detect the content type, but you can specify `arrayBuffer` to receive a Buffer you can read from and interact with.

## Example

For an example, refer to the [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost/v1/MattermostV1.node.ts){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Deprecation of the previous helper

The previous helper implementation using `this.helpers.request(options)` used and exposed the `request-promise` library. This was removed in version 1.

To minimize incompatibility, n8n made a transparent conversion to another library called `Axios`.

If you are having issues, please report them in the [Community Forums](https://community.n8n.io/){:target=_blank .external-link} or on [GitHub](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues){:target=_blank .external-link}.

## Migration guide to the new helper

The new helper is much more robust, library agnostic, and easier to use.

New nodes should all use the new helper. You should strongly consider migrating existing custom nodes to the new helper. These are the main considerations when migrating:

- Accepts `url`. Doesn't accept `uri`.
- `encoding: null` now must be `encoding: arrayBuffer`.
- `rejectUnauthorized: false` is now `skipSslCertificateValidation: true`
- Use `body` according to `content-type` headers to clarify the payload.
- `resolveWithFullResponse` is now `returnFullResponse` and has similar behavior

# Declarative-style parameters

These are the parameters available for [node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/index.md) of declarative-style nodes.

This document gives short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For a full walk-through of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to [Build a declarative-style node](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node.md).

Refer to [Standard parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/standard-parameters.md) for parameters available to all nodes.

## `methods` and `loadOptions`

_Object_ | _Optional_

`methods` contains the `loadOptions` object. You can use `loadOptions` to query the service to get user-specific settings, then return them and render them in the GUI so the user can include them in subsequent queries. The object must include routing information for how to query the service, and output settings that define how to handle the returned options. For example:

```js
methods : {
	loadOptions: {
		routing: {
			request: {
				url: '/webhook/example-option-parameters',
				method: 'GET',
			},
			output: {
				postReceive: [
					{
						// When the returned data is nested under another property
						// Specify that property key
						type: 'rootProperty',
						properties: {
							property: 'responseData',
						},
					},
					{
						type: 'setKeyValue',
						properties: {
							name: '={{$responseItem.key}} ({{$responseItem.value}})',
							value: '={{$responseItem.value}}',
						},
					},
					{
						// If incoming data is an array of objects, sort alphabetically by key
						type: 'sort',
						properties: {
							key: 'name',
						},
					},
				],
			},
		},
	}
},
```

## `routing`

_Object_ | _Required_

`routing` is an object used within an `options` array in operations and input field objects. It contains the details of an API call.

The code example below comes from the [Declarative-style tutorial](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node.md). It sets up an integration with a NASA API. It shows how to use `requestDefaults` to set up the basic API call details, and `routing` to add information for each operation.

```js
description: INodeTypeDescription = {
  // Other node info here
  requestDefaults: {
			baseURL: 'https://api.nasa.gov',
			url: '',
			headers: {
				Accept: 'application/json',
				'Content-Type': 'application/json',
			},
		},
    properties: [
      // Resources here
      {
        displayName: 'Operation'
        // Other operation details
        options: [
          {
            name: 'Get'
            value: 'get',
            description: '',
            routing: {
              request: {
                method: 'GET',
                url: '/planetary/apod'
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
}
```

## `version`

_Number_ or _Array_ | _Optional_

If you have one version of your node, this can be a number. If you want to support more than one version, turn this into an array, containing numbers for each node version.

n8n supports two methods of node versioning, but declarative-style nodes must use the light versioning approach. Refer to [Node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning.md) for more information.

# Node base file

The node base file contains the core code of your node. All nodes must have a base file. The contents of this file are different depending on whether you're building a declarative-style or programmatic-style node. For guidance on which style to use, refer to [Choose your node building approach](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method.md).

These documents give short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For full walk-throughs of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to [Build a declarative-style node](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node.md) or [Build a programmatic-style node](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/programmatic-style-node.md).

You can also explore the [n8n-nodes-starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter){:target=_blank .external-link} and n8n's own [nodes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes){:target=_blank .external-link} for a wider range of examples. The starter contains basic examples that you can build on. The n8n [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost) is a good example of a more complex programmatic-style node, including versioning.

For all nodes, refer to the:

* [Structure of the node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/structure.md)
* [Standard parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/standard-parameters.md)

For declarative-style nodes, refer to the:

* [Declarative-style parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/declarative-style-parameters.md)

For programmatic-style nodes, refer to the:

* [Programmatic-style parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/programmatic-style-parameters.md)
* [Programmatic-style execute() method](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/programmatic-style-execute-method.md)

description: A reference document for the programmatic-style execute() method of the node base file.
contentType: reference
---

# Programmatic-style execute() method

The main difference between the declarative and programmatic styles is how they handle incoming data and build API requests. The programmatic style requires an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles requests using the `routing` key in the `operations` object.

The `execute()` method creates and returns an instance of `INodeExecutionData`.

/// warning | Paired items
You must include input and output item pairing information in the data you return. For more information, refer to [Paired items](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/paired-items.md).

# Programmatic-style parameters

These are the parameters available for [node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/index.md) of programmatic-style nodes.

This document gives short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For a full walk-through of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to [Build a programmatic-style node](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/programmatic-style-node.md).

Programmatic-style nodes also use the `execute()` method. Refer to [Programmatic-style execute method](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/programmatic-style-execute-method.md) for more information.

Refer to [Standard parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/standard-parameters.md) for parameters available to all nodes.

## `defaultVersion`

_Number_ | _Optional_

Use `defaultVersion` when using the full versioning approach.

n8n support two methods of node versioning. Refer to [Node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning.md) for more information.

## `methods` and `loadOptions`

_Object_ | _Optional_

Contains the `loadOptions` method for programmatic-style nodes. You can use this method to query the service to get user-specific settings (such as getting a user's email labels from Gmail), then return them and render them in the GUI so the user can include them in subsequent queries.

For example, n8n's [Gmail node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Gmail/Gmail.node.ts) uses `loadOptions` to get all email labels:

```js
	methods = {
		loadOptions: {
			// Get all the labels and display them
			async getLabels(
				this: ILoadOptionsFunctions,
			): Promise<INodePropertyOptions[]> {
				const returnData: INodePropertyOptions[] = [];
				const labels = await googleApiRequestAllItems.call(
					this,
					'labels',
					'GET',
					'/gmail/v1/users/me/labels',
				);
				for (const label of labels) {
					const labelName = label.name;
					const labelId = label.id;
					returnData.push({
						name: labelName,
						value: labelId,
					});
				}
				return returnData;
			},
		},
	};
```

## `version`

_Number_ or _Array_ | _Optional_

Use `version` when using the light versioning approach.

If you have one version of your node, this can be a number. If you want to support multiple versions, turn this into an array, containing numbers for each node version.

n8n support two methods of node versioning. Programmatic-style nodes can use either. Refer to [Node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning.md) for more information.

contentType: reference
---

# Standard parameters

These are the standard parameters for the [node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/index.md). They're the same for all node types.

## `displayName`

_String_ | _Required_

This is the name users see in the n8n GUI.

## `name`

_String_ | _Required_

The internal name of the object. Used to reference it from other places in the node.

## `icon`

_String_ or _Object_ | _Required_

Specifies an icon for a particular node. n8n recommends uploading your own image file. 

You can provide the icon file name as a string, or as an object to handle different icons for light and dark modes.
If the icon works in both light and dark modes, use a string that starts with `file:`, indicating the path to the icon file. For example:

```
icon: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.svg'
```
To provide different icons for light and dark modes, use an object with `light` and `dark` properties. For example:
```
icon: { 
  light: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.svg', 
  dark: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.dark.svg' 
}
```

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/creating-nodes/node-icons.md"

## `group`

_Array of strings_ | _Required_

Tells n8n how the node behaves when the workflow runs. Options are:

* `trigger`: node waits for a trigger.
* `schedule`: node waits for a timer to expire.
* `input`, `output`, `transform`: these currently have no effect.
* An empty array, `[]`. Use this as the default option if you don't need `trigger` or `schedule`.

## `description`

_String_ | _Required_

A short description of the node. n8n uses this in the GUI.

## `defaults`

_Object_ | _Required_

Contains essential brand and name settings.

The object can include:

* `name`: String. Used as the node name on the canvas if the `displayName` is too long.
* `color`: String. Hex color code. Provide the brand color of the integration for use in n8n.

## `forceInputNodeExecution`

_Boolean_ | _Optional_

When building a multi-input node, you can choose to force all preceding nodes on all branches to execute before the node runs. The default is `false` (requiring only one input branch to run).

## `inputs`

_Array of strings_ | _Required_

Names the input connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the input side. If you need only one connector, use `input: ['main']`.


## `outputs`

_Array of strings_ | _Required_  

Names the output connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the output side. If you need only one connector, use `output: ['main']`.

## `requiredInputs`

_Integer_ or _Array_ | _Optional_

Used for multi-input nodes. Specify inputs by number that must have data (their branches must run) before the node can execute.

## `credentials`

_Array of objects_ | _Required_  

This parameter tells n8n the credential options. Each object defines an authentication type.

The object must include:

* `name`: the credential name. Must match the `name` property in the credential file. For example, `name: 'asanaApi'`  in [`Asana.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Asana/Asana.node.ts){:target=_blank .external-class} links to `name = 'asanaApi'` in [`AsanaApi.credential.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/credentials/AsanaApi.credentials.ts){:target=_blank .external-class}.
* `required`: Boolean. Specify whether authentication is required to use this node.

## `requestDefaults`

_Object_ | _Required_  

Set up the basic information for the API calls the node makes.

This object must include:

* `baseURL`: The API base URL.

You can also add:

* `headers`: an object describing the API call headers, such as content type.
* `url`: string. Appended to the `baseURL`. You can usually leave this out. It's more common to provide this in the `operations`.

## `properties`

_Array of objects_ | _Required_  

This contains the resource and operations objects that define node behaviors, as well as objects to set up mandatory and optional fields that can receive user input.

### Resource objects

A resource object includes the following parameters:

* `displayName`: String. This should always be `Resource`.
* `name`: String. This should always be `resource`.
* `type`: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements.md) for more information.
* `noDataExpression`: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be `true` for `resource`. 

### Operations objects

The operations object defines the available operations on a resource.

* `displayName`: String. This should always be `Options`.
* `name`: String. This should always be `option`.
* `type`: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, `dateTime` results in n8n adding a date picker. Refer to [Node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements.md) for more information.
* `noDataExpression`: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be `true` for `operation`.
* `options`: Array of objects. Each objects describes an operation's behavior, such as its routing, the REST verb it uses, and so on. An `options` object includes:
	* `name`. String.
	* `value`. String.
	* `action`: String. This parameter combines the resource and operation. You should always include it, as n8n will use it in future versions. For example, given a resource called `"Card"` and an operation `"Get all"`, your action is `"Get all cards"`.
	* `description`: String.
	* `routing`: Object containing request details.

### Additional fields objects

These objects define optional parameters. n8n displays them under **Additional Fields** in the GUI. Users can choose which parameters to set.

The objects must include:

```js
displayName: 'Additional Fields',
name: 'additionalFields',
// The UI element type
type: ''
placeholder: 'Add Field',
default: {},
displayOptions: {
  // Set which resources and operations this field is available for
  show: {
    resource: [
      // Resource names
    ],
    operation: [
      // Operation names
    ]
  },
}
```

# Structure of the node base file

The node base file follows this basic structure:

1. Add import statements.
2. Create a class for the node.
3. Within the node class, create a `description` object, which defines the node.

A programmatic-style node also has an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles this using the `routing` key in the `properties` object, within `descriptions`.

## Outline structure for a declarative-style node

This code snippet gives an outline of the node structure. 

```js
import { INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow';

export class ExampleNode implements INodeType {
	description: INodeTypeDescription = {
		// Basic node details here
		properties: [
			// Resources and operations here
		]
	};
}
```

import { IExecuteFunctions } from 'n8n-core';
import { INodeExecutionData, INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow';

export class ExampleNode implements INodeType {
	description: INodeTypeDescription = {
    // Basic node details here
    properties: [
      // Resources and operations here
    ]
  };

  async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> {
    // Process data and return
  }
};
```

Refer to [Standard parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/standard-parameters.md) for information on parameters available to all node types. Refer to [Programmatic-style parameters](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/programmatic-style-parameters.md) and [Programmatic-style execute method](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/programmatic-style-execute-method.md) for more information on working with programmatic-style nodes.

# Node codex files

The codex file contains metadata about your node. This file is the JSON file at the root of your node. For example, the [`HttpBin.node.json`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/blob/master/nodes/HttpBin/HttpBin.node.json){:target=_blank .external-class} file in the n8n starter. 

The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named `MyNode.node.ts`, the codex would be named `MyNode.node.json`.

| Parameter | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `node`    | Includes the node name. Must start with `n8n-nodes-base.`. For example, `n8n-nodes-base.openweatherapi`. | 
| `nodeVersion` | The node version. This should have the same value as the `version` parameter in your main node file. For example, `"1.0"`. |
| `codexVersion` | The codex file version. The current version is `"1.0"`. |
| `categories` | The settings in the `categories` array determine which category n8n adds your node to in the GUI. See [Node categories](#node-categories) for more information. |
| `resources` | The `resources` object contains links to your node documentation. n8n automatically adds help links to credentials and nodes in the GUI. |

## Node categories

You can define one or more categories in your node configuration JSON. This helps n8n put the node in the correct category in the nodes panel.

Choose from these categories:

* Data & Storage
* Finance & Accounting
* Marketing & Content
* Productivity
* Miscellaneous
* Sales
* Development
* Analytics
* Communication
* Utility

You must match the syntax. For example, `Data & Storage` not `data and storage`.

# Node file structure

Following best practices and standards in your node structure makes your node easier to maintain. It's helpful if other people need to work with the code.

The file and directory structure of your node depends on:

* Your node's complexity.
* Whether you use node versioning.
* How many nodes you include in the npm package.

## Required files and directories

Your node must include:

* A `package.json` file at the root of the project. This is required for any npm module.
* A `nodes` directory, containing the code for your node:
    * This directory must contain the [base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/index.md), in the format `<node-name>.node.ts`. For example, `MyNode.node.ts`.
    * n8n recommends including a [codex file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-codex-files.md), containing metadata for your node. The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named `MyNode.node.ts`, the codex name is `MyNode.node.json`.
    * The `nodes` directory can contain other files and subdirectories, including directories for versions, and node code split across more than one file to create a modular structure.
* A `credentials` directory, containing your credentials code. This code lives in a single [credentials file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/credentials-files.md). The filename format is `<node-name>.credentials.ts`. For example, `MyNode.credentials.ts`.

## Modular structure
<!-- vale off -->
You can choose whether to place all your node's functionality in one file, or split it out into a base file and other modules, which the base file then imports. Unless your node is very simple, it's a best practice to split it out.
<!-- vale on -->

A basic pattern is to separate out operations. Refer to the [HttpBin starter node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/tree/master/nodes/HttpBin){:target=_blank .external-link} for an example of this.

For more complex nodes, n8n recommends a directory structure. Refer to the [Airtable node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable){:target=_blank .external-class} or [Microsoft Outlook node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Microsoft/Outlook){:target=_blank .external-link} as examples. 

  * `actions`: a directory containing sub-directories that represent resources.
    * Each sub-directory should contain two types of files: 
      * An index file with resource description (named either `<resourceName>.resource.ts` or `index.ts`) 
      * Files for operations `<operationName>.operation.ts`. These files should have two exports: `description` of the operation and an `execute` function.
  * `methods`: an optional directory dynamic parameters' functions.  
  * `transport`: a directory containing the communication implementation.


## Versioning

If your node has more than one version, and you're using full versioning, this makes the file structure more complex. You need a directory for each version, along with a base file that sets the default version. Refer to [Node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning.md) for more information on working with versions, including types of versioning.

## Decide how many nodes to include in a package

There are two possible setups when building a node:

* One node in one npm package.
* More than one node in a single npm package.

n8n supports both approaches. If you include more than one node, each node should have its own directory in the `nodes` directory.

## A best-practice example for programmatic nodes

n8n's built-in [Airtable node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable){:target=_blank .external-class} implements a modular structure and versioning, following recommended patterns.

# Node versioning

n8n supports node versioning. You can make changes to existing nodes without breaking the existing behavior by introducing a new version.

Be aware of how n8n decides which node version to load:

* If a user builds and saves a workflow using version 1, n8n continues to use version 1 in that workflow, even if you create and publish a version 2 of the node.
* When a user creates a new workflow and browses for nodes, n8n always loads the latest version of the node.

/// note | Versioning type restricted by node style
If you build a node using the declarative style, you can't use full versioning.
///
## Light versioning

This is available for all node types.

One node can contain more than one version, allowing small version increments without code duplication. To use this feature: 

1. Change the main `version` parameter to an array, and add your version numbers, including your existing version. 
2. You can then access the version parameter with `@version` in your `displayOptions` in any object (to control which versions n8n displays the object with). You can also query the version from a function using `const nodeVersion = this.getNode().typeVersion;`.

As an example, say you want to add versioning to the NasaPics node from the [Declarative node tutorial](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node.md), then configure a resource so that n8n only displays it in version 2 of the node. In your base `NasaPics.node.ts` file:

```js
{
    displayName: 'NASA Pics',
    name: 'NasaPics',
    icon: 'file:nasapics.svg',
    // List the available versions
    version: [1,2,3],
    // More basic parameters here
    properties: [
        // Add a resource that's only displayed for version2
        {
            displayName: 'Resource name',
            // More resource parameters
            displayOptions: {
                show: {
                    '@version': 2,
                },
            },
        },
    ],
}
```

## Full versioning

This isn't available for declarative-style nodes.

As an example, refer to the [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost){:target=_blank .external-link}.

Full versioning summary:

- The base node file should extend `NodeVersionedType` instead of `INodeType`.
- The base node file should contain a description including the `defaultVersion` (usually the latest), other basic node metadata such as name, and a list of versions. It shouldn't contain any node functionality.
- n8n recommends using `v1`, `v2`, and so on, for version folder names.

# Node user interface elements

n8n provides a set of predefined UI components (based on a JSON file) that allows users to input all sorts of data types. The following UI elements are available in n8n.

## String

Basic configuration:

```typescript
{
	displayName: Name, // The value the user sees in the UI
	name: name, // The name used to reference the element UI within the code
	type: string,
	required: true, // Whether the field is required or not
	default: 'n8n',
	description: 'The name of the user',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```


![String](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/string.png)


String field for inputting passwords:

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Password',
	name: 'password',
	type: 'string',
	required: true,
	typeOptions: {
		password: true,
	},
	default: '',
	description: `User's password`,
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

![Password](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/password.png)


String field with more than one row:

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Description',
	name: 'description',
	type: 'string',
	required: true,
	typeOptions: {
		rows: 4,
	},
	default: '',
	description: 'Description',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

![Multiple rows](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/multiple-rows.png)

### Support drag and drop for data keys

Users can drag and drop data values to map them to fields. Dragging and dropping creates an [expression](/glossary.md#expression-n8n) to load the data value. n8n supports this automatically.

You need to add an extra configuration option to support dragging and dropping data keys:

* `requiresDataPath: 'single'`: for fields that require a single string.
* `requiresDataPath: 'multiple'`: for fields that can accept a comma-separated list of string.

The [Compare Datasets node code](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/CompareDatasets/CompareDatasets.node.ts){:target=_blank .external-link} has examples.

## Number

Number field with decimal points:

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Amount',
	name: 'amount',
	type: 'number',
	required: true,
	typeOptions: {
		maxValue: 10,
		minValue: 0,
		numberPrecision: 2,
	},
	default: 10.00,
	description: 'Your current amount',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

![Decimal](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/decimal.png)

## Collection

Use the `collection` type when you need to display optional fields.

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Filters',
	name: 'filters',
	type: 'collection',
	placeholder: 'Add Field',
	default: {},
	options: [
		{
			displayName: 'Type',
			name: 'type',
			type: 'options',
			options: [
				{
					name: 'Automated',
					value: 'automated',
				},
				{
					name: 'Past',
					value: 'past',
				},
				{
					name: 'Upcoming',
					value: 'upcoming',
				},
			],
			default: '',
		},
	],
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

![Collection](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/collection.png)


## DateTime

The `dateTime` type provides a date picker.

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Modified Since',
	name: 'modified_since',
	type: 'dateTime',
	default: '',
	description: 'The date and time when the file was last modified',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

![DateTime](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/datetime.png)



## Boolean

The `boolean` type adds a toggle for entering true or false.

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Wait for Image',
	name: 'waitForImage',
	type: 'boolean',
	default: true, // Initial state of the toggle
	description: 'Whether to wait for the image or not',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

![Boolean](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/boolean.png)

## Color

The `color` type provides a color selector.

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Background Color',
	name: 'backgroundColor',
	type: 'color',
	default: '', // Initially selected color
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

![Color](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/color.png)

## Options

The `options` type adds an options list. Users can select a single value.

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Resource',
	name: 'resource',
	type: 'options',
	options: [
		{
			name: 'Image',
			value: 'image',
		},
		{
			name: 'Template',
			value: 'template',
		},
	],
	default: 'image', // The initially selected option
	description: 'Resource to consume',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

![Options](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/options.png)

## Multi-options

The `multiOptions` type adds an options list. Users can select more than one value.

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Events',
	name: 'events',
	type: 'multiOptions',
	options: [
		{
			name: 'Plan Created',
			value: 'planCreated',
		},
		{
			name: 'Plan Deleted',
			value: 'planDeleted',
		},
	],
	default: [], // Initially selected options
	description: 'The events to be monitored',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

![Multi-options](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/multioptions.png)


## Filter

Use this component to evaluate, match, or filter incoming data.

This is the code from n8n's own If node. It shows a filter component working with a [collection](#collection) component where users can configure the filter's behavior.

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Conditions',
	name: 'conditions',
	placeholder: 'Add Condition',
	type: 'filter',
	default: {},
	typeOptions: {
		filter: {
			// Use the user options (below) to determine filter behavior
			caseSensitive: '={{!$parameter.options.ignoreCase}}',
			typeValidation: '={{$parameter.options.looseTypeValidation ? "loose" : "strict"}}',
		},
	},
},
{
displayName: 'Options',
name: 'options',
type: 'collection',
placeholder: 'Add option',
default: {},
options: [
	{
		displayName: 'Ignore Case',
		description: 'Whether to ignore letter case when evaluating conditions',
		name: 'ignoreCase',
		type: 'boolean',
		default: true,
	},
	{
		displayName: 'Less Strict Type Validation',
		description: 'Whether to try casting value types based on the selected operator',
		name: 'looseTypeValidation',
		type: 'boolean',
		default: true,
	},
],
},
```

![Filter](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/filter.png)


## Assignment collection (drag and drop)

Use the drag and drop component when you want users to pre-fill name and value parameters with a single drag interaction.

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Fields to Set',
	name: 'assignments',
	type: 'assignmentCollection',
	default: {},
},
```

You can see an example in n8n's [Edit Fields (Set) node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/0faeab1228e26d69a2a93bdb2f89523cca1e4036/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Set/v2){:target=_blank .external-link}:

![A gif showing the drag and drop action, as well as changing a field to fixed](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/set/drag-drop-fixed-toggle.gif)

## Fixed collection

Use the `fixedCollection` type to group fields that are semantically related.

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Metadata',
	name: 'metadataUi',
	placeholder: 'Add Metadata',
	type: 'fixedCollection',
	default: '',
	typeOptions: {
		multipleValues: true,
	},
	description: '',
	options: [
		{
			name: 'metadataValues',
			displayName: 'Metadata',
			values: [
				{
					displayName: 'Name',
					name: 'name',
					type: 'string',
					default: 'Name of the metadata key to add.',
				},
				{
					displayName: 'Value',
					name: 'value',
					type: 'string',
					default: '',
					description: 'Value to set for the metadata key.',
				},
			],
		},
	],
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

![Fixed collection](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/fixed-collection.png)



## Resource locator

![Resource locator](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/resource-locator.png)

The resource locator element helps users find a specific resource in an external service, such as a card or label in Trello. 

The following options are available:

* ID
* URL
* List: allows users to select or search from a prepopulated list. This option requires more coding, as you must populate the list, and handle searching if you choose to support it.

You can choose which types to include.

Example:

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Card',
	name: 'cardID',
	type: 'resourceLocator',
	default: '',
	description: 'Get a card',
	modes: [
		{
			displayName: 'ID',
			name: 'id',
			type: 'string',
			hint: 'Enter an ID',
			validation: [
				{
					type: 'regex',
					properties: {
						regex: '^[0-9]',
						errorMessage: 'The ID must start with a number',
					},
				},
			],
			placeholder: '12example',
			// How to use the ID in API call
			url: '=http://api-base-url.com/?id={{$value}}',
		},
		{
			displayName: 'URL',
			name: 'url',
			type: 'string',
			hint: 'Enter a URL',
			validation: [
				{
					type: 'regex',
					properties: {
						regex: '^http',
						errorMessage: 'Invalid URL',
					},
				},
			],
			placeholder: 'https://example.com/card/12example/',
			// How to get the ID from the URL
			extractValue: {
				type: 'regex',
				regex: 'example.com/card/([0-9]*.*)/',
			},
		},
		{
			displayName: 'List',
			name: 'list',
			type: 'list',
			typeOptions: {
				// You must always provide a search method
				// Write this method within the methods object in your base file
				// The method must populate the list, and handle searching if searchable: true
				searchListMethod: 'searchMethod',
				// If you want users to be able to search the list
				searchable: true,
				// Set to true if you want to force users to search
				// When true, users can't browse the list
				// Or false if users can browse a list
				searchFilterRequired: true,
			},
		},
	],
	displayOptions: {
		// the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			],
		},
	},
},
```

Refer to the following for live examples:

* Refer to [`CardDescription.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Trello/CardDescription.ts){:target=_blank .external-link} and [`Trello.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Trello/Trello.node.ts){:target=_blank .external-link}  in n8n's Trello node for an example of a list with search that includes `searchFilterRequired: true`.
* Refer to [`GoogleDrive.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Drive/GoogleDrive.node.ts){:target=_blank .external-link} for an example where users can browse the list or search.

## Resource mapper

If your node performs insert, update, or upsert operations, you need to send data from the node in a format supported by the service you're integrating with. A common pattern is to use a Set node before the node that sends data, to convert the data to match the schema of the service you're connecting to. The resource mapper UI component provides a way to get data into the required format directly within the node, rather than using a Set node. The resource mapper component can also validate input data against the schema provided in the node, and cast input data into the expected type.

/// note | Mapping and matching
Mapping is the process of setting the input data to use as values when updating row(s). Matching is the process of using column names to identify the row(s) to update. 
///	

```js
{
	displayName: 'Columns',
	name: 'columns', // The name used to reference the element UI within the code
	type: 'resourceMapper', // The UI element type
	default: {
		// mappingMode can be defined in the component (mappingMode: 'defineBelow')
		// or you can attempt automatic mapping (mappingMode: 'autoMapInputData')
		mappingMode: 'defineBelow',
		// Important: always set default value to null
		value: null,
	},
	required: true,
	// See "Resource mapper type options interface" below for the full typeOptions specification
	typeOptions: {
		resourceMapper: {
			resourceMapperMethod: 'getMappingColumns',
			mode: 'update',
			fieldWords: {
				singular: 'column',
				plural: 'columns',
			},
			addAllFields: true, 
			multiKeyMatch: true,
			supportAutoMap: true,
			matchingFieldsLabels: {
				title: 'Custom matching columns title',
				description: 'Help text for custom matching columns',
				hint: 'Below-field hint for custom matching columns',
			},
		},
	},
},
```

Refer to the [Postgres node (version 2)](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Postgres/v2){:target=_blank .external-link} for a live example using a database schema.

Refer to the [Google Sheets node (version 2)](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Sheet/v2){:target=_blank .external-link} for a live example using a schema-less service.

### Resource mapper type options interface

The `typeOptions` section must implement the following interface:

```js
export interface ResourceMapperTypeOptions {
	// The name of the method where you fetch the schema
	// Refer to the Resource mapper method section for more detail
	resourceMapperMethod: string;
	// Choose the mode for your operation
	// Supported modes: add, update, upsert
	mode: 'add' | 'update' | 'upsert';
	// Specify labels for fields in the UI
	fieldWords?: { singular: string; plural: string };
	// Whether n8n should display a UI input for every field when node first added to workflow
	// Default is true
	addAllFields?: boolean;
	// Specify a message to show if no fields are fetched from the service 
	// (the call is successful but the response is empty)
	noFieldsError?: string;
	// Whether to support multi-key column matching
	// multiKeyMatch is for update and upsert only
	// Default is false
	// If true, the node displays a multi-select dropdown for the matching column selector
	multiKeyMatch?: boolean;
	// Whether to support automatic mapping
	// If false, n8n hides the mapping mode selector field and sets mappingMode to defineBelow
	supportAutoMap?: boolean;
	// Custom labels for the matching columns selector
	matchingFieldsLabels?: {
		title?: string;
		description?: string;
		hint?: string;
	};
}
```

### Resource mapper method

This method contains your node-specific logic for fetching the data schema. Every node must implement its own logic for fetching the schema, and setting up each UI field according to the schema.

It must return a value that implements the `ResourceMapperFields` interface:

```js
interface ResourceMapperField {
	// Field ID as in the service
	id: string;
	// Field label
	displayName: string;
	// Whether n8n should pre-select the field as a matching field
	// A matching field is a column used to identify the rows to modify
	defaultMatch: boolean;
	// Whether the field can be used as a matching field
	canBeUsedToMatch?: boolean;
	// Whether the field is required by the schema
	required: boolean;
	// Whether to display the field in the UI
	// If false, can't be used for matching or mapping
	display: boolean;
	// The data type for the field
	// These correspond to UI element types
	// Supported types: string, number, dateTime, boolean, time, array, object, options
	type?: FieldType;
	// Added at runtime if the field is removed from mapping by the user
	removed?: boolean;
	// Specify options for enumerated types
	options?: INodePropertyOptions[];
}
```

Refer to the [Postgres resource mapping method](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Postgres/v2/methods/resourceMapping.ts){:target=_blank .external-link} and [Google Sheets resource mapping method](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Sheet/v2/methods/resourceMapping.ts){:target=_blank .external-link} for live examples.

## JSON

```typescript
{
	displayName: 'Content (JSON)',
	name: 'content',
	type: 'json',
	default: '',
	description: '',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

![JSON](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/json.png)


## HTML

The HTML editor allows users to create HTML templates in their workflows. The editor supports standard HTML, CSS in `<style>` tags, and expressions wrapped in `{{}}`. Users can add `<script>` tags to pull in additional JavaScript. n8n doesn't run this JavaScript during workflow execution.

```js
{
	displayName: 'HTML Template', // The value the user sees in the UI
	name: 'html', // The name used to reference the element UI within the code
	type: 'string',
	typeOptions: {
		editor: 'htmlEditor',
	},
	default: placeholder, // Loads n8n's placeholder HTML template
	noDataExpression: true, // Prevent using an expression for the field
	description: 'HTML template to render',
},
```

Refer to [`Html.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Html/Html.node.ts){:target=_blank .external-link} for a live example.


## Notice

Display a yellow box with a hint or extra info. Refer to [Node UI design](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/node-ui-design.md) for guidance on writing good hints and info text.

```js
{
  displayName: 'Your text here',
  name: 'notice',
  type: 'notice',
  default: '',
},
```
![Notice](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/notice.png)

## Hints

There are two types of hints: parameter hints and node hints:

* Parameter hints are small lines of text below a user input field.
* Node hints are a more powerful and flexible option than [Notice](#notice). Use them to display longer hints, in the input panel, output panel, or node details view. 

### Add a parameter hint

Add the `hint` parameter to a UI element:

```ts
{
	displayName: 'URL',
	name: 'url',
	type: 'string',
	hint: 'Enter a URL',
	...
}
```

### Add a node hint

Define the node's hints in the `hints` property within the node `description`:

```ts
description: INodeTypeDescription = {
	...
	hints: [
		{
			// The hint message. You can use HTML.
			message: "This node has many input items. Consider enabling <b>Execute Once</b> in the node\'s settings.",
			// Choose from: info, warning, danger. The default is 'info'.
			// Changes the color. info (grey), warning (yellow), danger (red)
			type: 'info',
			// Choose from: inputPane, outputPane, ndv. By default n8n displays the hint in both the input and output panels.
			location: 'outputPane',
			// Choose from: always, beforeExecution, afterExecution. The default is 'always'
			whenToDisplay: 'beforeExecution',
			// Optional. An expression. If it resolves to true, n8n displays the message. Defaults to true.
			displayCondition: '={{ $parameter["operation"] === "select" && $input.all().length > 1 }}'
		}
	]
	...
}
```

### Add a dynamic hint to a programmatic-style node

In programmatic-style nodes you can create a dynamic message that includes information from the node execution. As it relies on the node output data, you can't display this type of hint until after execution.

```ts
if (operation === 'select' && items.length > 1 && !node.executeOnce) {
    // Expects two parameters: NodeExecutionData and an array of hints
	return new NodeExecutionOutput(
		[returnData],
		[
			{
				message: `This node ran ${items.length} times, once for each input item. To run for the first item only, enable <b>Execute once</b> in the node settings.`,
				location: 'outputPane',
			},
		],
	);
}
return [returnData];
```

For a live example of a dynamic hint in a programmatic-style node, view the [Split Out node code](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Transform/SplitOut/SplitOut.node.ts#L266){:target=_blank .external-link}.

# UX guidelines for community nodes

Your node's UI must conform to these guidelines to be a [verified community node](/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/submit-community-nodes.md#submit-your-node-for-verification-by-n8n) candidate.

## Credentials

API key and sensitive credentials should always be password fields.

### OAuth

Always include the OAuth credential if available.

## Node structure

### Operations to include

Try to include **CRUD** operations for each resource type.

Try to include common operations in nodes for each resource. n8n uses some CRUD operations to keep the experience consistent and allow users to perform basic operations on the resource. The suggested operations are:

* **Create**
* **Create or Update (Upsert)**
* **Delete**
* **Get**
* **Get Many:** also used when some filtering or search is available
* **Update**

Notes:

1. These operations can apply to the resource itself or an entity inside of the resource (for example, a row inside a Google Sheet). When operating on an entity inside of the resource, you must specify the **name of the entity** in the operations name.
2. The naming could change depending on the node and the resource. Check the following guidelines for details.

### Resource Locator

* Use a Resource Locator component whenever possible. This provides a much better UX for users. The Resource Locator Component is most often useful when you have to select a single item.
* The default option for the Resource Locator Component should be `From list` (if available).

### Consistency with other nodes

* Maintain UX consistency: n8n tries to keep its UX consistent. This means following existing UX patterns, in particular, those used in the latest new or overhauled nodes.
* Check similar nodes: For example, if you're working on a database node, it's worth checking the Postgres node.

### Sorting options

* You can enhance certain "Get Many" operations by providing users with sorting options.
* Add sorting in a dedicated collection (below the "Options" collection). Follow the example of [Airtable Record:Search](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/92e2a8e61a4189025e5d4bac8be81576b624fe85/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable/v2/actions/record/search.operation.ts#L85-L135).

## Node functionality

### Deleting operations output

When deleting an item (like a record or a row), return an array with a single object: `{"deleted": true}`. This is a confirmation for the user that the deletion was successful and the item will trigger the following node.

### Simplifying output fields

#### Normal nodes: 'Simplify' parameter

When an endpoint returns data with more than 10 fields, add the "Simplify" boolean parameter to return a simplified version of the output with max 10 fields.

* One of the main issues with n8n can be the size of data and the Simplify parameter limits that problem by reducing data size.
* Select the most useful fields to output in the simplified node and sort them to have the most used ones at the top.
* In the Simplify mode, it's often best to flatten nested fields
* Display Name: `Simplify`
* Description: `Whether to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data`

#### AI tool nodes: ‘Output’ parameter

When an endpoint returns data with more than 10 fields, add the 'Output' option parameter with 3 modes.

In AI tool nodes, allow the user to be more granular and select the fields to output. The rationale is that tools may run out of context window and they can get confused by too many fields, so it's better to pass only the ones they need.

Options:

* **Simplified:** Works the same as the "Simplify" parameter described above.
* **Raw:** Returns all the available fields.
* **Selected fields:** Shows a multi-option parameter for selecting the fields to add to the output and send to the AI agent. By default, this option always returns the ID of the record/entity.

## Copy

### Text Case

Use **Title Case** for the node `name`, `parameters display names` (labels), `dropdown titles`. Title Case is when you capitalize the first letter of each word, except for certain small words, such as articles and short prepositions.

Use **Sentence case** for node `action` names, node `descriptions`, `parameters descriptions` (tooltips), `hints`, `dropdown descriptions`.

### Terminology

* **Use the third-party service terminology:** Try to use the same terminology as the service you're interfacing with (for example, Notion 'blocks', not Notion 'paragraphs').
* **Use the terminology used in the UI:** Stick to the terminology used in the user interface of the service, rather than that used in the APIs or technical documentation (for example, in Trello you "archive" cards, but in the API they show up as "closed". In this case, you might want to use "archive").
* **No tech jargon:** Don't use technical jargon where simple words will do. For example, use "field" instead of "key".
* **Consistent naming:** Choose one term for something and stick to it. For example, don't mix "directory" and "folder".

### Placeholders

It's often helpful to insert examples of content in parameters placeholders. These should start with "e.g." and use **camel case** for the demo content in fields.

Placeholder examples to copy:

* image: `e.g. https://example.com/image.png`
* video: `e.g. https://example.com/video.mp4`
* search term: `e.g. automation`
* email: `e.g. nathan@example.com`
* Twitter user (or similar): `e.g. n8n`
* Name and last name: `e.g. Nathan Smith`
* First name: `e.g. Nathan`
* Last name: `e.g. Smith`

### Operations name, action, and description

* **Name:** This is the name displayed in the select when the node is open on the canvas. It must use title case and doesn't have to include the resource (for example, "Delete").
* **Action:** This is the name of the operation displayed in the panel where the user selects the node. It must be in sentence case and must include the resource (for example, "Delete record").
* **Description:** This is the sub-text displayed below the name in the select when the node is open on the canvas. It must use sentence case and must include the resource. It can add a bit of information and use alternative words than the basic resource/operation (for example, "Retrieve a list of users").
* If the operation acts on an entity that's not the Resource (for example, a row in a Google Sheet), specify that in the operation name (for example, "Delete Row").

As a general rule, is important to understand what the **object** of an operation is. Sometimes, the object of an Operation is the resource itself (for example, `Sheet:Delete` to delete a Sheet).

In other cases, the object of the operation isn't the resource, but something contained inside the resource (for example, `Table:Delete rows`, here the resource is the table, but what you are operating on are the rows inside of it).

#### Naming `name`

This is the name displayed in the select when the node is open on the canvas.

* Parameter: `name`
* Case: Title Case

Naming guidelines:

* **Don't repeat the resource (if the resource selection is above):** The resource is often displayed above the operation, so it's not necessary to repeat it in the operation (this is the case if the object of the operation is the resource itself).
	* For example: `Sheet:Delete` → No need to repeat `Sheet` in `Delete`, because n8n displays `Sheet` in the field above and what you're deleting is the Sheet.
* **Specify the resource if there's no resource selection above:** In some nodes, you won't have a resource selection (because there's only one resource). In these cases, specify the resource in the operation.
	* For example: `Delete Records` → In Airtable, there's no resource selection, so it's better to specify that the Delete operation will delete records.
* **Specify the object of the operation if it's not the resource:** Sometimes, the object of the operation isn't the resource. In these cases, specify the object in the operation as well.
	* For example: `Table:Get Columns` → Specify `Columns` because the resource is `Table`, while the object of the operation is `Columns`.

#### Naming `action`

This is the name of the operation displayed in the panel where the user selects the node.
* Parameter: `action`
* Case: Sentence case

Naming guidelines:

* **Omit articles:** To keep the text shorter, get rid of articles (a, an, the…).
	* **correct**: `Update row in sheet`
	* **incorrect**: `Update a row in a sheet`
* **Repeat the resource:** In this case, it's okay to repeat the resource. Even if the resource is visible in the list, the user might not notice and it's useful to repeat it in the operation label.
*  **Specify the object of the operation if it is not the resource:** Same as for the operation name. In this case, you don't need to repeat the resource.
	* For example: `Append Rows` → You have to specify `Rows` because rows are what you're actually appending to. Don't add the resource (`Sheet`) since you aren't appending to the resource.

#### Naming `description`

This is the subtext displayed below the name in the selection when the node is open on the canvas.

* Parameter: `description`
* Case: Sentence case

Naming guidelines:

*  If possible, add more information than that specified in the operation `name`
*  Use alternative wording to help users better understand what the operation is doing. Some people might not understand the text used in the operation (maybe English isn't their native language), and using alternative working could help them.

#### Vocabulary

n8n uses a general vocabulary and some context-specific vocabulary for groups of similar applications (for example, databases or spreadsheets).

The general vocabulary takes inspiration from CRUD operations:

* **Clear**
    * Delete all the contents of the resource (empty the resource).
    * Description: `Delete all the <CHILD_ELEMENT>s inside the <RESOURCE>`
* **Create**
    * Create a new instance of the resource.
    * Description: `Create a new <RESOURCE>`
* **Create or Update**
    * Create or update an existing instance of the resource.
    * Description: `Create a new <RESOURCE> or update an existing one (upsert)`
* **Delete**
    * You can use "Delete" in two different ways:
        1. Delete a resource:
            * Description: `Delete a <RESOURCE> permanently` (use "permanently" only if that's the case)
        2. Delete something **inside** of the resource (for example, a row):
            * In this case, **always specify the object of the operation**: for example, `Delete Rows` or `Delete Records`.
            * Description: `Delete a <CHILD_ELEMENT> permanently`
* **Get**
    * You can use "Get" in two different ways:
        1. Get a resource:
            * Description: `Retrieve a <RESOURCE>`
        2. Get an item **inside** of the resource (for example, records):
            * In this case, **always specify the object of the operation**: for example, `Get Row` or `Get Record`.
            * Description: `Retrieve a <CHILD_ELEMENT> from the/a <RESOURCE>`
* **Get Many**
    * You can use "Get Many" in two different ways:
        1. Get a list of resources (without filtering):
            * Description: `Retrieve a list of <RESOURCE>s`
        2. Get a list of items **inside** of the resource (for example, records):
            * In this case, **always specify the object of the operation**: for example, `Get Many Rows` or `Get Many Records`.
            * You can omit `Many`: `Get Many Rows` can be `Get Rows`.
            * Description: `List all <CHILD_ELEMENT>s in the/a <RESOURCE>`
* **Insert** or **Append**
    * Add something inside of a resource.
    * Use `insert` for database nodes.
    * Description: `Insert <CHILD_ELEMENT>(s) in a <RESOURCE>`
* **Insert or Update** or **Append or Update**
    * Add or update something inside of a resource.
    * Use `insert` for database nodes.
    * Description: `Insert <CHILD_ELEMENT>(s) or update an existing one(s) (upsert)`
* **Update**
    * You can use "Update" in two different ways:
        1. Update a resource:
            * Description: `Update one or more <RESOURCE>s`
        2. Update something **inside** of a resource (for example, a row):
            * In this case, **always specify the object of the operation**: for example, `Update Rows` or `Update Records`.
            * Description: `Update <CHILD_ELEMENT>(s) inside a <RESOURCE>`

### Referring to parameter and field name

When you need to refer to parameter names or field names in copy, wrap them in single quotation marks (for example, "Please fill the `'name'` parameter).

### Boolean description

Start the description of boolean components with 'Whether...'

## Errors

### General philosophy

Errors are sources of pain for users. For this reason, n8n always wants to tell the user:

* **What happened**: a description of the error and what went wrong.
* **How to solve the problem**: or at least how to get unstuck and continue using n8n without problems. n8n doesn't want users to remain blocked, so use this as an opportunity to guide them to success.

### Error structure in the Output panel

#### Error Message - What happened

This message explains to the user what happened, and the current issue that prevents the execution completing.

* If you have the `displayName` of the parameter that triggered the error, include it in the error message or description (or both).
* Item index: if you have the ID of the item that triggered the error, append `[Item X]` to the error message. For example, `The ID of the release in the parameter “Release ID” for could not be found [item 2]`.
* Avoid using words like "error", "problem", "failure", "mistake".

#### Error Description - How to solve or get unstuck

The description explains to users how to solve the problem, what to change in the node configuration (if that's the case), or how to get unstuck. Here, you should guide them to the next step and unblock them.

Avoid using words like "error", "problem", "failure", "mistake".

# Community node verification guidelines

/// note | Do you want n8n to verify your node?
Consider following these guidelines while building your node if you want to submit it for verification by n8n. Any user with verified community nodes enabled can discover and install verified nodes from n8n's nodes panel.
///

## Package source verification

* Verify that your npm package repository URL matches the expected GitHub (or other platform) repository.
* Confirm that the package author / maintainer matches between npm and the repository.
* Confirm that the git link in npm works and that the repository is public.
* Make sure your package has proper documentation (README, usage examples, etc.).
* Make sure your package license is MIT.

## No external dependencies

* Ensure that your package does **not** include any external dependencies to keep it lightweight and easy to maintain.

## Proper documentation

* Provide clear documentation, whether it’s a **README** on GitHub or links to relevant **API documentation**.
* Include usage instructions, example workflows, and any necessary authentication details.

## No access to environment variables or file system

* The code **must not** interact with environment variables or attempt to read/write files.
* Pass all necessary data through node parameters.

## Follow n8n best practices

* Maintain a clear and consistent coding style.
* Use **TypeScript** and follow n8n's [**node development guidelines**](/integrations/creating-nodes/overview.md).
* Ensure proper error handling and validation.
* Make sure the linter passes (in other words, make sure running `npx @n8n/scan-community-package n8n-nodes-PACKAGE` passes).

# Deploy a node

This section contains details on how to deploy and share your node.

You can choose to:

* [Submit your node to the community node repository](/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/submit-community-nodes.md). This makes it available for everyone to use, and allows you to [install and use it](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/index.md) like any other community node. This is the only way to use custom nodes on cloud.
* Install the node into your n8n instance as a [private node](/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/install-private-nodes.md).

# Install private nodes

You can build your own nodes and install them in your n8n instance without publishing them on npm. This is useful for nodes that you create for internal use only at your company.

## Install your node in a Docker n8n instance

If you're running n8n using Docker, you need to create a Docker image with the node installed in n8n. 

1. Create a Dockerfile and paste the code from [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/Dockerfile).

	Your Dockerfile should look like this:

	```Dockerfile
	FROM node:16-alpine

	ARG N8N_VERSION

	RUN if [ -z "$N8N_VERSION" ] ; then echo "The N8N_VERSION argument is missing!" ; exit 1; fi

	# Update everything and install needed dependencies
	RUN apk add --update graphicsmagick tzdata git tini su-exec

	# Set a custom user to not have n8n run as root
	USER root

	# Install n8n and the packages it needs to build it correctly.
	RUN apk --update add --virtual build-dependencies python3 build-base ca-certificates && \
		npm config set python "$(which python3)" && \
		npm_config_user=root npm install -g full-icu n8n@${N8N_VERSION} && \
		apk del build-dependencies \
		&& rm -rf /root /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && mkdir /root;


	# Install fonts
	RUN apk --no-cache add --virtual fonts msttcorefonts-installer fontconfig && \
		update-ms-fonts && \
		fc-cache -f && \
		apk del fonts && \
		find  /usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/ -type l -exec unlink {} \; \
		&& rm -rf /root /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && mkdir /root

	ENV NODE_ICU_DATA /usr/local/lib/node_modules/full-icu

	WORKDIR /data

	COPY docker-entrypoint.sh /docker-entrypoint.sh
	ENTRYPOINT ["tini", "--", "/docker-entrypoint.sh"]

	EXPOSE 5678/tcp
	```

2. Compile your custom node code (`npm run build` if you are using nodes starter). Copy the **node** and **credential** folders from within the **dist** folder into your container's `~/.n8n/custom/` directory. This makes them available to Docker.

3. Download the [docker-entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/docker-entrypoint.sh) file, and place it in the same directory as your Dockerfile.

4. Build your Docker image:

	```Dockerfile
	# Replace <n8n-version-number> with the n8n release version number. 
	# For example, N8N_VERSION=0.177.0
	docker build --build-arg N8N_VERSION=<n8n-version-number> --tag=customizedn8n .
	```

You can now use your node in Docker.

## Install your node in a global n8n instance

If you've installed n8n globally, make sure that you install your node inside n8n. n8n will find the module and load it automatically.

# Choose your node building approach

n8n has two node-building styles, declarative and programmatic.

You should use the declarative style for most nodes. This style:

* Uses a JSON-based syntax, making it simpler to write, with less risk of introducing bugs.
* Is more future-proof.
* Supports integration with REST APIs.

The programmatic style is more verbose. You must use the programmatic style for:

* Trigger nodes
* Any node that isn't REST-based. This includes nodes that need to call a GraphQL API and nodes that use external dependencies.
* Any node that needs to transform incoming data.
* Full versioning. Refer to [Node versioning](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning.md) for more information on types of versioning.

## Data handling differences

The main difference between the declarative and programmatic styles is how they handle incoming data and build API requests. The programmatic style requires an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles this using the `routing` key in the `operations` object. Refer to [Node base file](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/index.md) for more information on node parameters and the `execute()` method.

## Syntax differences

To understand the difference between the declarative and programmatic styles, compare the two code snippets below. This example creates a simplified version of the SendGrid integration, called "FriendGrid." The following code snippets aren't complete: they emphasize the differences in the node building styles.

In programmatic style:

```js
import {
	IExecuteFunctions,
	INodeExecutionData,
	INodeType,
	INodeTypeDescription,
	IRequestOptions,
} from 'n8n-workflow';

// Create the FriendGrid class
export class FriendGrid implements INodeType {
  description: INodeTypeDescription = {
    displayName: 'FriendGrid',
    name: 'friendGrid',
    . . .
    properties: [
      {
        displayName: 'Resource',
        . . .
      },
      {
        displayName: 'Operation',
        name: 'operation',
        type: 'options',
        displayOptions: {
          show: {
              resource: [
              'contact',
              ],
          },
        },
        options: [
          {
            name: 'Create',
            value: 'create',
            description: 'Create a contact',
          },
        ],
        default: 'create',
        description: 'The operation to perform.',
      },
      {
        displayName: 'Email',
        name: 'email',
        . . .
      },
      {
        displayName: 'Additional Fields',
        // Sets up optional fields
      },
    ],
};

  async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> {
    let responseData;
    const resource = this.getNodeParameter('resource', 0) as string;
    const operation = this.getNodeParameter('operation', 0) as string;
    //Get credentials the user provided for this node
    const credentials = await this.getCredentials('friendGridApi') as IDataObject;

    if (resource === 'contact') {
      if (operation === 'create') {
      // Get email input
      const email = this.getNodeParameter('email', 0) as string;
      // Get additional fields input
      const additionalFields = this.getNodeParameter('additionalFields', 0) as IDataObject;
      const data: IDataObject = {
          email,
      };

      Object.assign(data, additionalFields);

      // Make HTTP request as defined in https://sendgrid.com/docs/api-reference/
      const options: IRequestOptions = {
        headers: {
            'Accept': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${credentials.apiKey}`,
        },
        method: 'PUT',
        body: {
            contacts: [
            data,
            ],
        },
        url: `https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing/contacts`,
        json: true,
      };
      responseData = await this.helpers.httpRequest(options);
      }
    }
    // Map data to n8n data
    return [this.helpers.returnJsonArray(responseData)];
  }
}
```

In declarative style:

```js
import { INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow';

// Create the FriendGrid class
export class FriendGrid implements INodeType {
  description: INodeTypeDescription = {
    displayName: 'FriendGrid',
    name: 'friendGrid',
    . . .
    // Set up the basic request configuration
    requestDefaults: {
      baseURL: 'https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing'
    },
    properties: [
      {
        displayName: 'Resource',
        . . .
      },
      {
        displayName: 'Operation',
        name: 'operation',
        type: 'options',
        displayOptions: {
          show: {
            resource: [
              'contact',
            ],
          },
        },
        options: [
          {
            name: 'Create',
            value: 'create',
            description: 'Create a contact',
            // Add the routing object
            routing: {
              request: {
                method: 'POST',
                url: '=/contacts',
                send: {
                  type: 'body',
                  properties: {
                    email: {{$parameter["email"]}}
                  }
                }
              }
            },
            // Handle the response to contact creation
            output: {
              postReceive: [
                {
                  type: 'set',
                  properties: {
                    value: '={{ { "success": $response } }}'
                  }
                }
              ]
            }
          },
        ],
        default: 'create',
        description: 'The operation to perform.',
      },
      {
        displayName: 'Email',
        . . .
      },
      {
        displayName: 'Additional Fields',
        // Sets up optional fields
      },
    ],
  }
  // No execute method needed
}
```

# Plan a node

This section provides guidance on designing your node, including key technical decisions such as choosing your node building style.

When building a node, there are design choices you need to make before you start:

* Which [node type](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/node-types.md) you need to build.
* Which [node building style](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method.md) to use.
* Your [UI design and UX principles](/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/node-ui-design.md)
* Your node's [file structure](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure.md).

# Node types: Trigger and Action

There are two node types you can build for n8n: trigger nodes and action nodes.

Both types provide integrations with external services. 

## Trigger nodes

[Trigger nodes](/glossary.md#trigger-node-n8n) start a workflow and supply the initial data. A workflow can contain multiple trigger nodes but with each execution, only one of them will execute, depending on the triggering event.

There are three types of trigger nodes in n8n: 

| Type | Description | Example Nodes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Webhook | Nodes for services that support webhooks. These nodes listen for events and trigger workflows in real time. | [Zendesk Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Zendesk){:target=_blank .external-link}, [Telegram Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Telegram){:target=_blank .external-link}, [Brevo Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Brevo){:target=_blank .external-link} |
| Polling | Nodes for services that don't support webhooks. These nodes periodically check for new data, triggering workflows when they detect updates. | [Airtable Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable){:target=_blank .external-link}, [Gmail Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Gmail){:target=_blank .external-link}, [Google Sheet Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Sheet){:target=_blank .external-link}, [RssFeed Read Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/RssFeedRead){:target=_blank .external-link} |
| Others | Nodes that handle real-time responses not related to HTTP requests or polling. This includes message queue nodes and time-based triggers. | [AMQP Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Amqp){:target=_blank .external-link}, [RabbitMQ Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/RabbitMQ){:target=_blank .external-link}, [MQTT Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/MQTT){:target=_blank .external-link}, [Schedule Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Schedule){:target=_blank .external-link}, [Email Trigger (IMAP)](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/EmailReadImap){:target=_blank .external-link} |

## Action nodes

Action nodes perform operations as part of your workflow. These can include manipulating data, and triggering events in other systems.

# Design your node's user interface

Most nodes are a GUI (graphical user interface) representation of an API. Designing the interface means finding a user-friendly way to represent API endpoints and parameters. Directly translating an entire API into form fields in a node may not result in a good user experience.

This document provides design guidance and standards to follow. These guidelines are the same as those used by n8n. This helps provide a smooth and consistent user experience for users mixing community and built-in nodes.

## Design guidance

All node's use n8n's [node UI elements](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements.md), so you don't need to consider style details such as colors, borders, and so on. However, it's still useful to go through a basic design process:

* Review the documentation for the API you're integrating. Ask yourself:
    * What can you leave out? 
    * What can you simplify?
    * Which parts of the API are confusing? How can you help users understand them?
* Use a wireframe tool to try out your field layout. If you find your node has a lot of fields and is getting confusing, consider n8n's guidance on [showing and hiding fields](#showing-and-hiding-fields).

## Standards

### UI text style

| Element | Style |
| ------- | ----- |
| Drop-down value | Title case |
| Hint | Sentence case |
| Info box | Sentence case. Don't use a period (`.`) for one-sentence information. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab. |
| Node name | Title case |
| Parameter name | Title case |
| Subtitle | Title case |
| Tooltip | Sentence case. Don't use a period (`.`) for one-sentence tooltips. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab. |

### UI text terminology

* Use the same terminology as the service the node connects to. For example, a Notion node should refer to Notion blocks, not Notion paragraphs, because Notion calls these elements blocks. There are exceptions to this rule, usually to avoid technical terms (for example, refer to the guidance on [name and description for upsert operations](#upsert-operations)).
* Sometimes a service has different terms for something in its API and in its GUI. Use the GUI language in your node, as this is what most users are familiar with. If you think some users may need to refer to the service's API docs, consider including this information in a hint.
* Don't use technical jargon when there are simpler alternatives.
* Be consistent when naming things. For example, choose one of `directory` or `folder` then stick to it. 

### Node naming conventions

| Convention | Correct | Incorrect |
| ---------- | ------- | --------- |
| If a node is a trigger node, <br>the displayed name should have 'Trigger' at the end, <br>with a space before. | Shopify Trigger | ShopifyTrigger, Shopify trigger |
| Don't include 'node' in the name. | Asana | Asana Node, Asana node |

### Showing and hiding fields

Fields can either be:

* Displayed when the node opens: use this for resources and operations, and required fields.
* Hidden in the **Optional fields** section until a user clicks on that section: use this for optional fields.

Progressively disclose complexity: hide a field until any earlier fields it depends on have values. For example, if you have a **Filter by date** toggle, and a **Date to filter by** datepicker, don't display **Date to filter by** until the user enables **Filter by date**.


### Conventions by field type

#### Credentials

n8n automatically displays credential fields as the top fields in the node.

#### Resources and operations

APIs usually involve doing something to data. For example, "get all tasks." In this example, "task" is the resource, and "get all" is the operation.

When your node has this resource and operation pattern, your first field should be **Resource**, and your second field should be **Operation**.

#### Required fields

Order fields by:

* Most important to least important.
* Scope: from broad to narrow. For example, you have fields for **Document**, **Page**, and **Text to insert**, put them in that order.

#### Optional fields

* Order fields alphabetically. To group similar things together, you can rename them. For example, rename **Email** and **Secondary Email** to **Email (primary)** and **Email (secondary)**.
* If an optional field has a default value that the node uses when the value isn't set, load the field with that value. Explain this in the field description. For example, **Defaults to false**.
* Connected fields: if one optional fields is dependent on another, bundle them together. They should both be under a single option that shows both fields when selected.
* If you have a lot of optional fields, consider grouping them by theme.

#### Help

There are five types of help built in to the GUI:

* Info boxes: yellow boxes that appear between fields. Refer to [UI elements | Notice](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements.md#notice) for more information.
  * Use info boxes for essential information. Don't over-use them. By making them rare, they stand out more and grab the user's attention.
* Parameter hints: lines of text displayed beneath a user input field. Use this when there's something the user needs to know, but an info box would be excessive.
* Node hints: provide help in the input panel, output panel, or node details view. Refer to [UI elements | Hints](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements.md#hints) for more information.
* Tooltips: callouts that appear when the user hovers over the tooltip icon !["Screenshot of the tooltip icon. The icon is a ? in a grey circle"](/_images/common-icons/help-tooltip.png). Use tooltips for extra information that the user might need.
  * You don't have to provide a tooltip for every field. Only add one if it contains useful information. 
  * When writing tooltips, think about what the user needs. Don't just copy-paste API parameter descriptions. If the description doesn't make sense, or has errors, improve it.
* Placeholder text: n8n can display placeholder text in a field where the user hasn't entered a value. This can help the user know what's expected in that field.

Info boxes, hints, and tooltips can contain links to more information.

#### Errors

Make it clear which fields are required.

Add validation rules to fields if possible. For example, check for valid email patterns if the field expects an email.

When displaying errors, make sure only the main error message displays in the red error title. More information should go in **Details**.

#### Toggles

* Tooltips for binary states should start with something like **Whether to . . . **.
* You may need a list rather than a toggle:
    * Use toggles when it's clear what happens in a false state. For example, **Simplify Output?**. The alternative (don't simplify output) is clear.
    * Use a dropdown list with named options when you need more clarity. For example, **Append?**. What happens if you don't append is unclear (it could be that nothing happens, or information is overwritten, or discarded).

#### Lists

* Set default values for lists whenever possible. The default should be the most-used option.
* Sort list options alphabetically.
* You can include list option descriptions. Only add descriptions if they provide useful information.
* If there is an option like **All**, use the word **All**, not shorthand like *****.

#### Trigger node inputs

When a trigger node has a parameter for specifying which events to trigger on:

* Name the parameter **Trigger on**.
* Don't include a tooltip.

#### Subtitles

Set subtitles based on the values of the main parameters. For example:

```js
subtitle: '={{$parameter["operation"] + ": " + $parameter["resource"]}}',
```

#### IDs

When performing an operation on a specific record, such as "update a task comment" you need a way to specify which record you want to change.

* Wherever possible, provide two ways to specify a record:
    * By choosing from a pre-populated list. You can generate this list using the `loadOptions` parameter. Refer to [Base files](/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/index.md) for more information.
    * By entering an ID.
* Name the field `<Record name> name or ID`. For example, **Workspace Name or ID**. Add a tooltip saying "Choose a name from the list, or specify an ID using an expression." Link to n8n's [Expressions](/code/expressions.md) documentation.
* Build your node so that it can handle users providing more information than required. For example:
    * If you need a relative path, handle the user pasting in the absolute path.
    * If the user needs to get an ID from a URL, handle the user pasting in the entire URL.

#### Dates and timestamps

n8n uses [ISO timestamp strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601){:target=_blank class=.external-link} for dates and times. Make sure that any date or timestamp field you add supports all ISO 8601 formats.

#### JSON

You should support two ways of specifying the content of a text input that expects JSON:

* Typing JSON directly into the text input: you need to parse the resulting string into a JSON object.
* Using an expression that returns JSON.



#### Node icons

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/node-icons.md"


### Common patterns and exceptions

This section provides guidance on handling common design patterns, including some edge cases and exceptions to the main standards.

#### Simplify responses

APIs can return a lot of data that isn't useful. Consider adding a toggle that allows users to choose to simplify the response data:

  * Name: **Simplify Response**
  * Description: **Whether to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data**

#### Upsert operations

This should always be a separate operation with:

  * Name: **Create or Update**
  * Description: **Create a new record, or update the current one if it already exists (upsert)**

#### Boolean operators
<!-- vale off -->
n8n doesn't have good support for combining boolean operators, such as AND and OR, in the GUI. Whenever possible, provide options for all ANDs or all ORs.
<!-- vale on -->

For example, you have a field called **Must match** to test if values match. Include options to test for **Any** and **All**, as separate options.

#### Source keys or binary properties

Binary data is file data, such as spreadsheets or images. In n8n, you need a named key to reference the data. Don't use the terms "binary data" or "binary property" for this field. Instead, use a more descriptive name: **Input data field name** / **Output data field name**.

# Test a node

This section contains information about testing your node.

There are two ways to test your node:

* Manually, by [running it on your own machine](/integrations/creating-nodes/test/run-node-locally.md) within a local n8n instance.
* Automatically, using the [linter](/integrations/creating-nodes/test/node-linter.md).

You should use both methods before publishing your node.

# n8n node linter

n8n's node linter, [`eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base`](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base), statically analyzes ("lints") the source code of n8n nodes and credentials in the official repository and in community packages. The linter detects issues and automatically fixes them to help you follow best practices.

`eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base` contains a [collection of rules](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base#ruleset) for node files (`*.node.ts`), resource description files (`*Description.ts`), credential files (`*.credentials.ts`), and the `package.json` of a community package.

## Setup

If using the [n8n node starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter): Run `npm install` in the starter project to install all dependencies. Once the installation finishes, the linter is available to you. 

If using VS Code, install the [ESLint VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.VS Code-eslint). For other IDEs, refer to their ESLint integrations.

/// note | Don't edit the configuration file
[`.eslintrc.js`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/blob/master/.eslintrc.js) contains the configuration for `eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base`. Don't edit this file.
///

## Usage

You can use the linter in a community package or in the main n8n repository.

### Linting

In a community package, the linter runs automatically after installing dependencies and before publishing the package to npm. In the [main n8n repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n){:target=_blank .external-link}, the linter runs automatically using GitHub Actions whenever you push to your pull request.

In both cases, VS Code lints in the background as you work on your project. Hover over a detected issue to see a full description of the linting and a link to further information.

You can also run the linter manually:

* Run `npm run lint` to lint and view detected issues in your console. 
* Run `npm run lintfix` to lint and automatically fix issues. The linter fixes violations of rules [marked as automatically fixable](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base#ruleset).

Both commands can run in the root directory of your community package, or in `/packages/nodes-base/` in the main repository.

### Exceptions

Instead of fixing a rule violation, you can also make an exception for it, so the linter doesn't flag it.

To make a lint exception from VS Code: hover over the issue and click on `Quick fix` (or `cmd+.` in macOS) and select **Disable {rule} for this line**. Only disable rules for a line where you have good reason to. If you think the linter is incorrectly reporting an issue, please [report it in the linter repository](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base/issues).

To add a lint exception to a single file, add a code comment. In particular, TSLint rules may not show up in VS Code and may need to be turned off using code comments. Refer to the [TSLint documentation](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/rule-flags/) for more guidance.

# Troubleshooting

## Credentials

<!-- vale off -->
### Error message: 'Credentials of type "*" aren't known'
<!-- vale on -->

Check that the name in the credentials array matches the name used in the property name of the credentials' class.

![Troubleshooting credentials](/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/troubleshooting-credentials-1.png)

<!-- vale off -->
## Editor UI
<!-- vale on -->

<!-- vale off -->
### Error message: 'There was a problem loading init data: API-Server can not be reached. It's probably down'
<!-- vale on -->

- Check that the names of the node file, node folder, and class match the path added to `packages/nodes-base/package.json`.
- Check that the names used in the `displayOptions` property are names used by UI elements in the node.

<!-- vale off -->
### Node icon doesn't show up in the Add Node menu and the Editor UI
<!-- vale on -->

- Check that the icon is in the same folder as the node.
- Check that it's either in PNG or SVG format.
- When the `icon` property references the icon file, check that it includes the logo extension (`.png` or `.svg`) and that it prefixes it with `file:`. For example, `file:friendGrid.png` or `file:friendGrid.svg`.

### Node icon doesn't fit

- If you use an SVG file, make sure the canvas size is square. You can find instructions to change the canvas size of an SVG file using GIMP [here](https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/gimp-image-resize.html).
- If you use a PNG file, make sure that it's 60x60 pixels.

### Node doesn't show up in the Add Node menu

Check that you registered the node in the `package.json` file in your project.

<!-- vale off -->
### Changes to the description properties don't show in the UI on refreshing
<!-- vale on -->

Every time you change the description properties, you have to stop the current n8n process (`ctrl` + `c`) and run it again. You may also need to re-run `npm link`.

### Linter incorrectly warning about file name case

The node linter has rules for file names, including what case they should be. Windows users may encounter an issue when renaming files that causes the linter to continue giving warnings, even after you rename the files. This is due to a [known Windows issue](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/file-renaming-when-changing-case-doesnt-work/aa15ff7c-dd2d-4ed3-bcce-799ca90d4e58) with changing case when renaming files.

## Predefined credential types

A predefined credential type is a credential that already exists in n8n. You can use predefined credential types instead of generic credentials in the HTTP Request node.

For example: you create an Asana credential, for use with the Asana node. Later, you want to perform an operation that isn't supported by the Asana node, using Asana's API. You can use your existing Asana credential in the HTTP Request node to perform the operation, without additional authentication setup.

### Using predefined credential types

### Credential scopes

Some existing credential types have specific scopes: endpoints that they work with. n8n warns you about this when you select the credential type.

For example, follow the steps in [Using predefined credential types](#using-predefined-credential-types), and select **Google Calendar OAuth2 API** as your **Credential Type**. n8n displays a box listing the two endpoints you can use this credential type with:

# Integrations

n8n calls integrations nodes.

Nodes are the building blocks of workflows in n8n. They're an entry point for retrieving data, a function to process data, or an exit for sending data. The data process includes filtering, recomposing, and changing data. There can be one or several nodes for your API, service or app. You can connect multiple nodes, which allows you to create complex workflows.

## Built-in nodes

n8n includes a collection of built-in integrations. Refer to [Built-in nodes](/integrations/builtin/node-types.md) for documentation on all n8n's built-in nodes.

## Community nodes

As well as using the built-in nodes, you can also install community-built nodes. Refer to [Community nodes](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/index.md) for more information.

## Credential-only nodes and custom operations

--8<-- "_snippets/integrations/credential-only-intro.md"

Refer to [Custom operations](/integrations/custom-operations.md) for more information.

## Generic integrations

If you need to connect to a service where n8n doesn't have a node, or a credential-only node, you can still use the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) node. Refer to the node page for details on how to set up authentication and create your API call.

## Where to go next
