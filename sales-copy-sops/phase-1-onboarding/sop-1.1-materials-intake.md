Hi [Client Name],

Thanks for sending over the materials! I've organized everything and am diving in.

I noticed a few items that would really help me write stronger copy:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- [Item 1] - This helps me [reason]
- [Item 2] - This helps me [reason]

HELPFUL BUT NOT URGENT:

## Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Client sends everything in one giant ZIP | Unzip and organize yourself; don't ask client to re-send |
| Materials are scattered across multiple emails | Compile a checklist and check off as you find each item |
| Product access doesn't work | Test within 24 hours of receiving and notify client immediately |
| Client doesn't have testimonials | Note as gap; plan to ask for customer contact info in kick-off |
| Files are poorly named | Rename everything yourself; faster than asking client |
