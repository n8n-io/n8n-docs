## Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Client is vague about what they need | Ask specific questions; provide options |
| Client wants everything but budget is limited | Prioritize ruthlessly; recommend phases |
| Technical requirements unclear | Flag for kick-off call; don't assume |
| Funnel doesn't make strategic sense | Note concerns; prepare to discuss in kick-off |
