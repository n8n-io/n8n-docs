## Interview Mindset

### What to Be
- **Curious** - Genuinely interested in their story
- **Present** - Fully engaged, not thinking about next question
- **Patient** - Let silences happen; they often lead to gold
- **Specific** - Push for details, examples, and exact phrases

### What to Avoid
- **Rushing** - Don't jump to next question too fast
- **Assuming** - Don't fill in blanks yourself
- **Leading** - Don't suggest answers
- **Multi-tasking** - Don't get distracted

---

## Key Question Techniques

### Follow-up Probes
When they give an answer, dig deeper:
- "Can you tell me more about that?"
- "What specifically do you mean by [X]?"
- "Can you give me an example?"
- "What exact words do your customers use?"
- "What happened next?"
- "How did that make them feel?"

### The "5 Whys" Technique
Keep asking "Why?" to get to root causes:
1. "Why do people struggle with this?" → Answer
2. "Why does that happen?" → Answer
3. "Why is that the case?" → Answer
4. "Why do you think that is?" → Answer
5. "Why does that matter?" → Deep insight

### The "Exact Words" Technique
Push for verbatim language:
- "What exact words do customers use when they describe this?"
- "If I were listening to a sales call, what would I hear them say?"
- "How do they describe this problem in their own words?"
