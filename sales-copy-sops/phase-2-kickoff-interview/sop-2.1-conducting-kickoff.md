## During-Call Best Practices

### Listening Techniques
| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **80/20 Rule** | Listen 80% of the time, talk 20% |
| **Silence is Gold** | Don't fill pauses - let them think |
| **Mirror Back** | Repeat their words: "So you're saying..." |
| **Go Deeper** | "Tell me more about that" |
| **Get Specific** | "Can you give me an example?" |
| **Capture Exact Words** | "What exact words do they use?" |

### Note-Taking Priority
1. **Exact quotes** (most valuable)
2. **Specific stories** (with details)
3. **Unique insights** (things you didn't know)
4. **Emotional moments** (where they got animated)
5. **Unanswered questions** (for research)

### Red Flags to Address
| Red Flag | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Generic answers | Probe for specifics |
| "I don't know" | Ask about specific customers |
| Going off-topic | Redirect gently |
| Low energy | Ask about success stories |
| Overly rehearsed | Ask unexpected follow-ups |

---

## Question Adaptation Guidelines

### If Customer Understanding is Weak
- Ask about specific recent customers by name
- Ask about sales conversations
- Ask about support tickets/complaints
- Ask about refund requests (reveals problems)

### If Mechanism Isn't Clear
- Ask "Why does THIS work when other things don't?"
- Ask about the discovery/creation process
- Ask what they do differently than competitors
- Ask what their best customers say makes the difference

### If Stories Are Generic
- Ask for specific names and situations
- Ask for before/after with numbers
- Ask about the customer's emotional journey
- Ask what surprised them about the result
