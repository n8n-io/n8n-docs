4. Check user profiles for other subreddits they frequent

#### Method C: By Market Category

**Health & Fitness:**
- r/fitness, r/loseit, r/keto, r/nutrition

## Target Subreddits

### Primary (High relevance)
1. r/[subreddit] - [Why relevant] - [Members count]
2. r/[subreddit] - [Why relevant] - [Members count]
3. r/[subreddit] - [Why relevant] - [Members count]

### Secondary (Related)
1. r/[subreddit] - [Why relevant]
2. r/[subreddit] - [Why relevant]

### Tertiary (Tangential but useful)

```

### Step 2: Develop Search Queries
**[TIME: 15 minutes]**

Create targeted search queries:

#### Query Types

**Pain Point Queries:**
- "[problem]" (e.g., "can't lose weight")
- "struggling with [topic]"
- "frustrated with [topic]"
- "help with [problem]"
- "anyone else [problem]?"
- "[topic] is ruining my life"
- "sick of [problem]"

**Desire/Outcome Queries:**
- "how to [desired outcome]"
- "finally [achieved something]"
- "success with [topic]"
- "[outcome] changed my life"
- "best way to [goal]"

**Solution/Product Queries:**
- "[product category] recommendations"
- "has anyone tried [solution type]"
- "[solution] review"
- "best [product type]"
- "[competitor name]"

**Story Queries:**
- "my [topic] story"
- "transformation"
- "progress"
- "journey"
- "before and after"

**Create Your Query List:**
```markdown
## Search Queries

### Pain Point Queries
1. "[query 1]"
2. "[query 2]"

```

### Step 3: Execute Searches
**[TIME: 2-4 hours]**

For each subreddit and query combination:

1. Go to the subreddit
2. Use the search bar with your query
3. Sort by: Relevance first, then Top (All Time), then Top (Year)
4. Review top 20-50 results
5. Open promising threads in new tabs

## Advanced Reddit Techniques

### Technique 1: Google Site Search
More powerful than Reddit's native search:
```
site:reddit.com "[your search term]"
site:reddit.com/r/[subreddit] "[search term]"
```

### Technique 2: Third-Party Search Tools
- **Redditsearch.io** - Better search functionality
- **Pushshift** - Historical Reddit data
- **Later for Reddit** - Scheduling and analytics

### Technique 3: Sort Strategies
- **Top (All Time)** - The most resonant content ever
- **Top (Year/Month)** - Recent resonant content
- **Controversial** - Divisive topics, strong opinions
- **New** - Fresh perspectives and current concerns

### Technique 4: User Profile Mining
When you find someone who articulates well:
1. Click their username
2. View their post history
3. Find other relevant posts/comments
4. Note subreddits they frequent

### Technique 5: Comment Thread Deep-Dives
The best insights are often buried:
1. Expand collapsed comments
2. Sort comments by "Best" and "Controversial"
3. Follow reply chains
4. Look for disagreements (reveal objections)
