## Step-by-Step Procedure

### Step 1: Pain Point Pattern Analysis
**[TIME: 30 minutes]**

Review all pain points and identify patterns:

```markdown
## Pain Point Patterns

### Pattern 1: [Theme Name]
**Frequency:** [X sources, Y mentions]
**Sample Quotes:**
- "[Quote 1]"
- "[Quote 2]"
- "[Quote 3]"

**Intensity Analysis:**
- Emotional language used: [Examples]
- Urgency indicators: [Examples]
- Life impact described: [Examples]

**Validation:** [Does this align with kick-off call insights?]
**Copy Priority:** [1-5]
**Recommended Use:** [Headline/Opening/Pain section/etc.]

### Pattern 2: [Theme Name]
[Same structure...]
```

### Step 2: Desire Pattern Analysis
**[TIME: 25 minutes]**

```markdown
## Desire Patterns

### Pattern 1: [Theme Name]
**Frequency:** [X sources, Y mentions]
**Surface Desire:** [What they say they want]
**Deeper Desire:** [What they really want - emotional]
**Sample Quotes:**
- "[Quote 1]"
- "[Quote 2]"

**Copy Priority:** [1-5]
**Recommended Use:** [Promise/Dream outcome/CTA/etc.]
```

### Step 3: Failed Solution Pattern Analysis
**[TIME: 20 minutes]**

```markdown
## Failed Solution Patterns

### Pattern 1: [Common Solution Type]
**What People Try:** [Description]
**Why It Fails:** [Common reasons cited]
**How Often Mentioned:** [Frequency]
**Mechanism Implication:** [What this tells us about WHY things fail]
**Copy Angle:** [How to use for mechanism setup]
```

### Step 4: Objection Pattern Analysis
**[TIME: 20 minutes]**

```markdown
## Objection Patterns

### Objection Category 1: [Type]
**Specific Objections:**
- [Objection A] - Frequency: [X]
- [Objection B] - Frequency: [X]

**Root Concern:** [What's really behind these]
**When It Appears:** [Before purchase? After considering?]
**Priority to Address:** [1-5]
**How to Address:** [Copy approach]
```

### Step 5: Language Pattern Analysis
**[TIME: 20 minutes]**

```markdown
## Language Patterns

### Most Repeated Phrases (Pain)
| Phrase | Frequency | Sources |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| "[Phrase]" | [X times] | [Sources] |

### Most Repeated Phrases (Desire)
| Phrase | Frequency | Sources |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| "[Phrase]" | [X times] | [Sources] |

### Emotional Intensifiers Used
| Intensifier | Context | Frequency |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| "[Word/phrase]" | [When used] | [Count] |

### Metaphors/Analogies Used
| Metaphor | What It Describes | Source |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| "[Metaphor]" | [Concept] | [Source] |
```

### Step 6: Cross-Source Validation
**[TIME: 25 minutes]**

```markdown
## Cross-Source Validation

### Strongly Validated (3+ Sources)
| Insight | Sources | Confidence | Priority |
|---------|---------|------------|----------|
| [Insight] | [List] | High | 1 |

### Moderately Validated (2 Sources)
| Insight | Sources | Confidence | Priority |
|---------|---------|------------|----------|
| [Insight] | [List] | Medium | 2 |

### Single-Source (Needs Consideration)
| Insight | Source | Use If... | Priority |
|---------|--------|-----------|----------|
| [Insight] | [Source] | [Condition] | 3 |
```

### Step 7: Hypothesis Validation
**[TIME: 20 minutes]**

Compare research findings against initial hypotheses:

```markdown
## Hypothesis Validation

### Hypothesis 1: [From Brief v1.0]
**Original Hypothesis:** [What we thought]
**Research Finding:** [What we found]
**Verdict:** [Confirmed/Modified/Rejected]
**Updated Understanding:** [Refined view]

### Hypothesis 2: [From Brief v1.0]
[Same structure...]
```

### Step 8: Create Pattern Analysis Report
**[TIME: 30 minutes]**

## Project: [Name]
## Date: [Date]

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Top 3 Pain Point Patterns
1. [Pain pattern] - Priority: 1
2. [Pain pattern] - Priority: 2
3. [Pain pattern] - Priority: 3

### Top 3 Desire Patterns
1. [Desire pattern] - Priority: 1
2. [Desire pattern] - Priority: 2
3. [Desire pattern] - Priority: 3

### Primary Objections to Address
1. [Objection]
2. [Objection]
3. [Objection]

### Key Language Findings
- Primary pain phrase: "[Phrase]"
- Primary desire phrase: "[Phrase]"
- Most powerful metaphor: "[Metaphor]"

## DETAILED PATTERN ANALYSIS

[Include all analysis from Steps 1-7]

---

## COPY IMPLICATIONS

### For Headlines
Based on patterns, headlines should emphasize:
- [Primary angle]
- Using language like: "[Phrases]"

### For Opening/Hook
Based on patterns, opening should:
- Address: [Main pain pattern]
- Promise: [Main desire pattern]

### For Mechanism Section
Failed solution patterns suggest mechanism should address:
- [Why other things fail]
- [What makes this different]

### For Proof Section
Objection patterns suggest proof should include:
- [Type of proof needed]
- [Specific claims to support]

### For Offer
Gap patterns suggest offer should include:
- [Bonus/feature opportunity]
- [Risk reversal approach]
