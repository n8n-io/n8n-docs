# SOP 5.2: Irresistible Offer Design

## Purpose
Design the complete offer structure using Alex Hormozi's $100M Offers framework, creating an offer that feels like an irresistible "no-brainer" to the target customer.

## The Value Equation

```
                    Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement
VALUE = ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
               Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice

To increase value:
✓ INCREASE Dream Outcome (make the promise bigger/better)
✓ INCREASE Perceived Likelihood (add proof, reduce risk)
✓ DECREASE Time Delay (make results faster)
✓ DECREASE Effort & Sacrifice (make it easier)
```
