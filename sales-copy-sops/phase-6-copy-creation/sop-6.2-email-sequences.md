## Step-by-Step Writing Process

### Step 1: Subject Line

**Formula: Curiosity + Self-Interest**

```
[Curiosity hook] + [Hint at benefit]

Examples:
"A bird hit my window & left you a lesson..."
"The weird thing my mentor told me about [topic]..."
"Why most [audience] fail at [goal] (it's not what you think)"
"I made a mistake, and you can learn from it..."
"The $50,000 email that almost never got sent..."
```

**Subject Line Templates:**
1. Story tease: "[Unusual event] taught me [lesson]..."
2. Curiosity gap: "The [adjective] truth about [topic]..."
3. Question: "Why can't [audience] figure out [problem]?"
4. Number + curiosity: "[Number] [adjective] ways to [benefit] (even if [obstacle])"
5. Personal: "I was wrong about [topic]..."

### Step 2: Story Opening

**Story Sources:**
- Something that happened to you recently
- Something you observed or overheard
- Something you read or watched
- A client or customer experience
- A historical event or figure
- A pop culture reference
- A childhood memory
- A conversation you had

**Story Format:**
```
[Set the scene - 1-2 sentences]

[What happened - 3-5 sentences]

[The interesting/unexpected part - 2-3 sentences]
```

**Example:**
```
I was at the grocery store yesterday.

In line behind a guy who was arguing with the cashier
about a 37-cent coupon that wouldn't scan.

For 10 minutes. Holding up everyone.

And as I watched him, red-faced and frustrated over
a few cents, I realized something important about
[topic]...
```

### Step 3: Pivotal Point

**Purpose:** Extract the lesson that connects to your message.

**Transition Phrases:**
- "Here's the thing..."
- "That got me thinking..."
- "The lesson here is..."
- "What does this have to do with [topic]?"
- "Here's how this applies to you..."

**Format:**
```
[Lesson statement]

[Why it matters for them]

[How it connects to your solution/offer]
```

**Example:**
```
The lesson? Most people fight for pennies while
ignoring dollars.

Same thing happens with [topic].

People obsess over [small thing] while completely
missing [big thing] that actually makes the difference.
```

### Step 4: Transition to Pitch

**Smooth Transitions:**
```
"And that's exactly why I created..."
"Speaking of which..."
"Which brings me to..."
"If you want to learn how to..."
"And if you'd like to stop [pain] and start [benefit]..."
```

### Step 5: The Pitch

**Remember: Sell the CLICK, not the product**

**Pitch Structures:**

**Structure 1: Curiosity-Based**
```
I put together something that shows you exactly how to
[benefit] without [obstacle].

Inside, you'll discover:
- [Bullet 1]
- [Bullet 2]
- [Bullet 3]

Check it out here:
[Link]
```

**Structure 2: Direct**
```
If you want [benefit], I can help.

Go here:
[Link]

[P.S. with urgency/scarcity]
```

**Structure 3: Testimonial-Based**
```
[Name] used this to [result].

[Name] did too.

Want to see how they did it?
